  <h1 class="post-title">Did Abbas Actually Condemn Dafna Meir's Murder?</h1>
  <span class="post-date">19 Jan 2016</span>
  <p>The media has been making a lot of noise recently about Mahmoud Abbas’s “condemnation” of the brutal murder of Dafna Meir in front of her daughter. Speaking on <a href="http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy-defense/99674-160119-escalation-feared-after-israeli-settlements-stabbings">Palestinian TV broadcast from the Church of the Nativity</a>, the Palestinian dictator said, “We are concerned over every drop of blood from any person.”</p>

<p>How wonderfully heartfelt and specific. You can really feel his concern for Dafna’s husband, four children and two foster children who are now mourning their mother and wife who was stabbed to death in her own home.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to coax any Palestinian leader to condemn violence against Jews. But in this case, Abbas has not actually condemned anything. But this is worse than the standard “we condemn all violence” line from the Palestinian leadership. That is because if we look at Abbas’s previous statements, this is actually a dressed up version of his previous calls to violence!</p>

<p>Back on 16 September 2015, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/abbas-we-welcome-every-drop-of-blood-spilled-in-jerusalem-1445209820">he said the following on Palestinian TV</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We welcome every drop of blood spilled in Jerusalem. This is pure blood, clean blood, blood on its way to Allah. With the help of Allah, every martyr will be in heaven, and every wounded will get his reward.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, Abbas <em>is</em> concerned about “every drop of blood,” but he is concerned that not enough is being spilled!</p>

<p>He even makes this clear in the rest of his speech that is ignored or downplayed by the media. Abbas continues, saying, “the resistance will continue through peaceful means, and we will not call for anything else… We will stand firm on our land, and we will stay the course.”</p>

<p>Abbas is not condemning the attack in Otniel, he is reiterating his call for bloodshed, while at the same time claiming that Palestinian stabbing attacks on Jews are peaceful!</p>

<p>This is of course nothing new for the Palestinian leadership, but at least the PA is usually the one who says one thing in English and the exact opposite in Arabic. In this case, the media is doing Abbas’s job for him and ascribing false meaning to his words in their vain attempt to paint this extremist terrorist as a moderate peace partner.</p>
