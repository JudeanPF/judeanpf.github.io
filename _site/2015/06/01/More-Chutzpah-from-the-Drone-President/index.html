  <h1 class="post-title">More Chutzpah from the Drone President</h1>
  <span class="post-date">01 Jun 2015</span>
  <p>We already touched upon President Obama’s apparent lack of understanding of how <a href="http://judeanpf.com/2015/05/22/Anti-Semitism-and-Rationality/">anti-Semitism affects one’s rationality</a> in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/05/obama-interview-iran-isis-israel/393782/">his interview with Jeffrey Goldberg</a>. His inability to recognize how anti-Semitism shapes people’s thinking when they truly by into the Jew-hating lies is shameful, but not terribly surprising given the modern liberal tendency to believe that everyone, deep down, thinks just like they do. This is misguided and dangerous, but we would be hard pressed to ascribe this attitude to any nefarious ideas on the President’s part.</p>

<p>The same cannot be said of Obama’s view of how Israel relates to Palestinian children:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think it is true to Israel’s traditions and its values — its founding principles — that <strong>it has to care about those Palestinian kids</strong>. And when I was in Jerusalem and I spoke, the biggest applause that I got was when I spoke about those kids I had visited in Ramallah, and I said to a Israeli audience that it is profoundly Jewish, <strong>it is profoundly consistent with Israel’s traditions to care about them</strong>. And they agreed. <strong>So if that’s not translated into policy — if we’re not willing to take risks on behalf of those values</strong> — then those principles become empty words, and in fact, in my mind, <strong>it makes it more difficult for us to continue to promote those values when it comes to protecting Israel internationally</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement is utterly shocking, disgusting and offensive. The President of the country that is supposed to be Israel’s greatest ally, is saying to a Jewish audience that he believes Israel doesn’t care about Palestinian children and if it doesn’t change this alleged callousness, if it doesn’t take the “risks” that Obama outlines, then he threatens that the US will abandon Israel in the international community.</p>

<p>Perhaps Obama didn’t care about children when a strike he ordered killed 21 kids in Yemen just <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2014/01/23/more-than-2400-dead-as-obamas-drone-campaign-marks-five-years/">a week after he accepted his Nobel Peace Prize</a>? Or when on 12 December 2013, a drone attack in Yemen targeted a wedding party <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/america-tonight/america-tonight-blog/2014/1/17/what-really-happenedwhenausdronehitayemeniweddingconvoy.html">killing up to 15 civilians</a>?</p>

<p>Or perhaps the fact that, <a href="http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/04/16843014-justice-department-memo-reveals-legal-case-for-drone-strikes-on-americans">according to this administration</a>, an “imminent threat… does not require the United States to have clear evidence that a specific attack on U.S. persons and interests will take place in the immediate future.” shows the Drone President cares nothing for the lives of the people caught in the crossfire of his lax rules of engagement.</p>

<p>I suppose that although, according to NBC News analyst Michael Leiter, a former Obama administration counter-terrorism official, “the nature of intelligence is such that it really is unreasonable to expect that the US will always have specific evidence about a plot” before it attacks and such a ridiculous situation is entirely acceptable, but when Israel does have such evidence and acts, it only does so because “Israel doesn’t care about Palestinian kids.”</p>

<p>Apparently it is acceptable that “the CIA often counts able-bodied males, military-age males who are killed in strikes as militants, unless they have concrete evidence to sort of prove them innocent,” (according to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/04/opinion/pakistan-drone-attacks-akbar/">Scott Shane</a>) but Israel relying on similar but more reliable methods is a reflection of its heartlessness.</p>

<p>Does Obama not care about Pakistani children like <a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/02/14/i_no_longer_love_blue_skies_what_life_is_like_under_the_constant_threat_of_a_drone_attack_partner/">Zubair Rehman</a>, who testified before Congress that “I no longer love blue skies, in fact I now prefer grey skies, the drones do not fly when the skies are grey and for a short period of time the mental tension and fear eases.”?</p>

<p>Did President Obama not care about kids or civilians when his drone strikes, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/24/-sp-us-drone-strikes-kill-1147">aimed at killing 41 people, ended up killing 1,147</a>? Sounds like a <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4547145,00.html">“hell of a pinpoint operation”</a> to us.</p>

<p>Of course this is all rhetorical. Just because President Obama is authorizing drone strikes, does not mean he “doesn’t care about kids.” In fact, it shows that he is willing - in some circumstances at least - to take action to protect American children from terror attacks. But it does reveal a shocking level of hypocrisy that is rooted in anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/fs/2010/122352.htm">the State Department</a>, one of the modern examples of anti-Semitism is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Applying double standards by requiring of [Israel] a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the Drone President holds Israel to a higher standard than he even holds himself to, when he creates a standard that is impossible to live up to and only holds Israel to that standard, and then condemns Israel as “not caring about Palestinian kids,” when it fails this impossible standard, that is anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>When the Israel-Obsessed President condemns Israel for “not caring about Palestinian kids” but says nothing about the Islamic Resistance Movement’s <a href="http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/5230/hamas-army-children">child soldiers</a>, or Abbas’s Palestinian Authority <a href="https://t.co/cv9PHzFvwM">teaching children to love violence and anti-Semitism</a> or the use of children as suicide bombers and human shields, what does that say about how much Obama himself cares about Palestinian kids?</p>

<p>When the President condemns Israel for “not caring about Palestinian kids” despite the fact that it does more to limit civilian casualties than he does and ignores those actively putting Palestinian children in harm’s way, well, my people have a word for that:</p>

<p>###Chutzpah</p>
