  <h1 class="post-title">Calling BS on BDS - The Strategy of Divestment</h1>
  <span class="post-date">11 Nov 2015</span>
  <p>The second article in the <a href="http://www.endtheoccupation.org/downloads/divestguide.pdf">BDS Handbook</a> is “The Moral Imperative and Strategic Potential of Divestment” by Fayyad Sbaihat (p.9-10). The key part of the title is “Strategic Potential.”</p>

<p>In what is likely the biggest “win” for BDS, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/12/world/middleeast/eu-labels-israeli-settlements.html">EU has decided to begin to label products</a> from Israeli communities in Judea and Samaria, indicating they are from “occupied territory.” This is being done in order to make it easier for such products to be identified and boycotted by consumers.</p>

<p>Before we tear this apart, let’s examine where this idea started by looking at Mr. Sbaihat’s instructions to BDS activists who follow his lead:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Divestment</strong>, which itself is one form of boycott against Israel and its apartheid regime, had been introduced in North America as <strong>[a] stepping stone towards a broad, comprehensive boycott of Israel</strong>. As the Palestinian cause was severely mischaracterized in the US, and in the post 9-11 world of anti Arab and Muslim sentiment, <strong>a limited demand of boycott was the necessary approach</strong> to create a debate around the merits of boycott and Israel’s apartheid policies, and <strong>lay the foundation for the future comprehensive BDS call</strong>. (p. 9)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You read that correctly. The BDS movement admits to its activists that calls for a “targeted boycott of settlement products” is merely a strategic move that was necessary to “lay the foundation for the future comprehensive BDS call” against all of Israel! They don’t often say this to outsiders because this would mean they are actually advocating a boycott of the Jewish State and is not just against settlements.</p>

<p>####But this is exactly what the BDS movement is all about. It isn’t about settlements or occupied territory, it is about Israel itself.</p>

<p>If BDS-holes cared about occupied territory or major border disputes, they would be condemning and calling for boycotts of Morocco in Western Sahara, Turkey in Northern Cyprus, Russia in Ukraine, China in Tibet, Armenia in Nagorno-Karabakh, India in Kashmir or many others. But that is not the case. BDS supporters have even been found to <a href="http://www.thetower.org/2425-leading-anti-israel-activist-supports-illegal-occupation-of-nagorno-karabakh/">openly support settlements in occupied territories</a>, as long as those settlers were not Jews and even the government of France and major French companies like <em>Orange</em>](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/06/11/exposed-orange-telecom-involved-in-war-crimes-in-occupied-territories-according-to-french-official/), which recently pulled out of Israel entirely “because of the occupation,” conducts business in other occupied territories without the slightest hint of recognizing the hypocrisy.</p>

<p>That is what this is: hypocrisy. And when blatant hypocrisy is employed against Jews, that is called anti-Semitism. Calling into question Israeli policy in Judea and Samaria is not in and of itself anti-Semitic. However, if someone claims they are against occupation or settlements but never says a single word about this when it is done by non-Jews, or, as is often the case, is supportive of such actions by non-Jews in other places, then their problem clearly isn’t occupation or settlement, but rather Jews and that is the textbook definition of anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>While we believe boycotts and labeling of Israeli products from Judea and Samaria is wrong and counterproductive, if it was simultaneously done to products from all or most other occupied territories then the reasoning behind it would be clear and it would not be anti-Semitic. But if International Law is only applied to the Jewish State and no other, then it is not International nor is it Law.</p>

<p>###Is this really Anti-Semitism?</p>

<p>Some skeptical readers will look at this reasoning and think, “ok, that makes sense, but just because they only focus on Israel could also mean they just have a special interest in Palestinians, not Jews.” However, while this might be a somewhat acceptable answer for a failure to discuss other instances of occupation and settlement, this would not explain how BDS-holes openly justify occupation and settlements in other areas. It would also not explain a complete lack on the part of BDS to speak up for Palestinian rights that are violated daily in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and the rest of the Middle East.</p>

<p>What’s more, Sbaihat’s personal associations show that he is not merely anti-Israel or pro-Palestinian. <strong>He is a supporter of full blown anti-Semitism.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s take a look.</p>

<p>Here is a nice smiling picture of Fayyad Sbaihat from LinkedIn:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/pOkLfLt.jpg" alt="LinkedIn" /></p>

<p>And here is he with <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/nation-islam">Ashahed Muhammad</a>, Nation of Islam member and author of “The Synagogue of Satan,” (<a href="http://archive.adl.org/learn/extremism_in_america_updates/groups/new_black_panther_party_for_self_defense/shabazz_tei_21706.html#.VkJLlNKrTct">condemned by the ADL</a> for rabid anti-Semitism) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malik_Zulu_Shabazz">Malik “Zulu” Shabazz</a>, currently the National President of Black Lawyers for Justice and the former National Chairman of the New Black Panther Party who wrote the book’s forward.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/c8ARsZN.jpg" alt="Satan" /></p>

<p>Sbaihat can’t claim he didn’t know who these people were or that they wrote this anti-Semitic tome that rivals Mein Kampf in its Jew-hatred because he’s holding it in the picture! There’s even a demonic Jewish star right on the cover!</p>

<p>Look how proud <a href="https://myspace.com/ashahed/mixes/classic-my-photos-515367/photo/243833488">Muhammad and Shabazz</a> are of their Jew-hating book!</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JcXTzYV.jpg" alt="Satan Book" /></p>

<p>Let’s look at some of the things Sbaihat’s friend Shabazz has said:</p>

<p>While at a 1994 rally at Howard University, Shabazz revved up the crowd with this Jew-baiting <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/1998-09-29/news/keep-your-eye-on-malik-shabazz">call and response</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Who is it that caught and killed Nat Turner?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Jews!”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Who is it that controls the Federal Reserve?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Jews!”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Who is it that controls the media and Hollywood?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Jews!”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Who is it that has our entertainers… and our athletes in a vise grip?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Jews!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, in 2002, while protesting B’nai B’rith International in Washington D.C., <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/malik-zulu-shabazz">Shabazz yelled</a>, “Kill every goddamn Zionist in Israel! Goddamn little babies, goddamn old ladies! Blow up Zionist supermarkets!” At least that time he was “smart enough” to say Zionist instead of Jew, but no one with an ounce of intellectual honesty can say he wasn’t talking about Jews. Since hatred of Jews never ends with Jews, no one should be surprised that Shabazz also has a violently racist attitude against white people and routinely engages in homophobia.</p>

<p>BDS Leader Fayyad Sbaihat, who literally wrote the book on BDS, not only admits that boycotts of settlements is just a strategy to warm people up to full blown boycotts of Israel, but he openly associates with unabashed Jew-haters like Shabazz and Muhammad.</p>
