  <h1 class="post-title">The Concise Palestinian Dictionary</h1>
  <span class="post-date">27 Oct 2015</span>
  <p>One of the biggest problems supporters of Israel are encountering today is not just ideological - Zionism vs. radical Islam - but rather linguistic. We know that while Israel haters have no compunction about lying, most normal people do. So when promoting their radical agenda the BDS-holes have a major problem:</p>

<p>####How can people committed to ethnically cleansing Israel of Jews through terrorism, people who support violently misogynistic and homophobic organizations, gain the support of good-hearted, progressive westerners?</p>

<p>Sure, getting the media to promote lies like “attacks on the Temple Mount” or framing a Palestinian stabber as a victim rather than terrorist help, but that can only go so far.</p>

<p>In order to win over the West, the Palestinians have simply decided to redefine the English language in a way that casts them in a positive light. That is why when talking to Palestinians and their supporters one cannot just consult an <em>Concise Oxford English Dictionary</em>, rather one must consult the <em>Concise Palestinian Dictionary</em> to understand their true goals.</p>

<p>Below, you’ll find many important words with their Western definition and its Palestinian counterpart. You’ll notice the common factor among Palestinian definitions is that they are almost invariably the exact opposite of the true meaning. (If you have a word you think should be added, please tweet us at <a href="https://twitter.com/JudeanPF">@JudeanPF</a>).</p>

<p>##Apartheid</p>

<p>[<em>uh</em>-<strong>pahrt</strong>-hahyt, -heyt, <em>uh</em>-<strong>pahr</strong>-tahyt, -teyt]</p>

<p>Noun. or Adjective.</p>

<p>###Western Definition</p>

<p>A form of government in which an ethnic minority dominates over the ethnic majority through a system of laws and violence that enforce segregation and discrimination in all aspects of life.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: As we have shown none of the <a href="http://judeanpf.com/2015/07/27/Apartheid-Law-vs-Israeli-Law/">Apartheid Laws of South Africa exist in Israel</a> and most of them are explicitly illegal.</p>

<p>###Palestinian Definition</p>

<p>1- Any action - either large or small - taken by Israel that can be spun to sound racist in any way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.adalah.org/en/law/view/493">A law</a> preventing Israeli citizens from selling land to non-citizens for a certain period of time is labeled an “apartheid law” despite the fact that it applies to all non-Israelis (Jews included). Palestinians also label the security barrier an “apartheid wall” despite the fact that it was built to counter Palestinian suicide bombers (<a href="http://www.adl.org/israel-international/israel-middle-east/content/AG/inaccuracy-security-barrier.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/#.Vifq9OxVhHw">and worked</a>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2- Any action - even if it is exactly the same as what Israel is accused of doing - is no longer Apartheid when done by Palestinians or other Arabs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fact that marriages in Israel are only conducted via religious ceremonies thus preventing intermarriages (though those performed abroad are recognized) <em>is</em> apartheid, but when the Palestinian Authority adopts the exact same arrangement, it is not. Though Palestinian law punishes those who sell land to Jews with <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Abbas-adds-hard-labor-to-punishment-for-Palestinians-who-sell-land-to-hostile-countries-379350">death or life in prison with hard labor</a> since this isn’t Israeli law, it cannot be considered an apartheid law.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>##Ethnic Cleansing</p>

<p>[<strong>eth</strong>-nik klenz <strong>in</strong>g]</p>

<p>Noun.</p>

<p>###Western Definition</p>

<p>The elimination of an unwanted ethnic group or groups from a society, as by genocide or forced emigration. As a result, the population of a group that undergoes ethnic cleansing is invariably smaller afterwards.</p>

<p>###Palestinian Definition</p>

<p>1- Any act taken by Israel against a Palestinian individual, family or home, regardless of the act’s legality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a Palestinian illegally builds a home on land he does not own and is removed from it by Israel, that is ethnic cleansing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2- Ethnic cleansing need not significantly diminish the numbers of Palestinians in a given area.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DOyyQW1.jpg" alt="Nakba" /></p>

<p>3- Any military act undertaken by Israel, regardless of intent, action or result.</p>

<hr />

<p>##Execute</p>

<p>[<strong>ek</strong>-si-kyoot]</p>

<p>Verb.</p>

<p>###Western Definition</p>

<p>1- To inflict capital punishment on; put to death according to law.</p>

<p>2- To murder; assassinate.</p>

<p>##Palestinian Definition</p>

<p>1- For an Israeli to attack or shoot a Palestinian, regardless of whether or not this results in death.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After Ahmed Manasra stabbed a 13 year old Israeli on a bicycle, Mahmoud Abbas said he was executed even though <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/terrorist-abbas-said-executed-by-israel-shown-alive-in-hospital/">he is alive and well</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2- When Israel kills a Palestinian who is attacking a civilian or soldier.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The PA has complained that when Palestinian terrorists are killed while attacking Israelis, they are actually being “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/netanyahu-calls-palestinian-leader-a-liar-after-claims-of-execution/2015/10/15/da7a2a48-72b6-11e5-ba14-318f8e87a2fc_story.html">executed in cold-blood</a>.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>##Freedom Fighter</p>

<p>[<strong>free</strong>-d<em>uh</em> m <strong>fahy</strong>-ter]</p>

<p>Noun.</p>

<p>###Western Definition</p>

<p>One who forcefully but peacefully struggles against tyranny in the pursuit of freedom for an oppressed people.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>:Given the Western axiom that “justice can only be pursued through just means,” a Freedom Fighter must only target the system that is engaging in oppression and not innocents.</p>

<p>Notable Examples of Western Freedom Fighters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mahatma Ghandi</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Freedom Riders</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Partisans of WWII</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>###Palestinian Definition</p>

<p>Anyone who fights against Israel regardless of their actions. It doesn’t matter if they attack soldiers, children or people on an airplane, anyone engaged in the “fight for Palestine” is automatically a Freedom Fighter.</p>

<p>Notable Examples of Palestinian Freedom Fighters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Suicide Bombers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children who stab Jews</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Airline Hijackers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Murderers of Olympic Athletes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>###Palestinian Definition</p>

<p>1- Any military act taken by Israel regardless of intent, action or result.</p>

<p>2- The mere presence of Israel in the West Bank and Gaza. This despite the fact that its presence has lead to a marked increase in population.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/457fgjA.jpg" alt="West Bank" /></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ig2AuMd.jpg" alt="Gaza" /></p>

<p>3- Catchall term for members of the Jewish faith, Israelite nation and Hebrew ethnicities.</p>

<p>###Palestinian Definition</p>

<p>1- Solely a religious group with no national character.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Terrorism/PLO_Covenant_commentary.html">Article 20 of the Palestine National Charter</a> describes this by saying: “The claim of historical or religious ties between Jews and Palestine does not tally with historical realities, nor with the constituents of statehood in their true sense. Judaism, in its character as a religion, is not a nationality with an independent existence.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2- A minority who lived happily and in perfect harmony under Muslim rule before the arrival of Zionists.</p>

<hr />

<p>##Judaize</p>

<p>[<strong>joo</strong>-dee-ahyz, -dey-, -d<strong>uh</strong>-]</p>

<p>Verb.</p>

<p>###Western Definition</p>

<p>1- To make something Jewish.</p>

<p>2- To convert to Judaism.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: In order for something to be Judaized, by definition it cannot already be or have previously been Jewish.</p>

<p>###Palestinian Definition</p>

<p>1- To have Jews move into an area.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jews moving to Jerusalem, despite there already being a Jewish majority and a 3000 year old connection to the city, constitutes Judaization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2- To have Jews discuss the Jewish history of or religious connection to any site.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any discussion of Jewish history on, Jewish connection to or rights for freedom of worship, on the Temple Mount, constitutes an attempt to Judaize the site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: While most hate groups around the world code their language when complaining about “too many Jews moving into their neighborhood,” the Palestinians openly lament an increase in Jewish neighbors. Though they will often say they are only complaining about Israelis, they only seem to be bothered when those Israelis are Jewish.</p>

<hr />

<p>##Justice</p>

<p>[<strong>juhs</strong>-tis]</p>

<p>Noun.</p>

<p>###Western Definition</p>

<p>1- The quality of being just; righteousness, equitableness, or moralrightness.</p>

<p>2- The moral principle determining just conduct.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Given the Western axiom that “justice can only be pursued through just means,” true Justice cannot be done by way of injustice.</p>

<p>###Palestinian Definition</p>

<p>1- The right to flood Israel with a Palestinian majority.</p>

<p>2- Replacing Israel with an Islamic and kleptocratic state with an Arab majority.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Palestinian insistence on peace <strong>and</strong> justice is designed to prevent an end of the conflict that does not include the “right” of the “<a href="http://judeanpf.com/2015/02/26/about-palestinian-refugees/">refugees</a>” to move to Israel. One can compromise for the sake of peace, but cannot compromise for justice, which is why the Palestinians put so much emphasis on “justice.”</p>

<hr />

<p>##Peace</p>

<p>1- The normal, non-warring condition of a nation, group of nations, or the world.</p>

<p>2- Any law enacted in Israel that promotes or establishes Jewish values, culture or history.</p>

<p>3- Any law enacted in Israel that makes it difficult for terrorists carry out attacks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.adalah.org/en/law/view/490">Laws restricting but not preventing terrorists</a> - both Jew and Arab - from meeting with their lawyers is labeled racist, despite the fact that many terrorists have used such meetings to coordinate attacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4- Any law or action - even if it is exactly the same as what Israel is accused of doing - is no longer racist when done by Palestinians or other Arabs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Law of Return is racist as it only applies to Jews but the “Right of Return” is not. Calling Israel a Jewish State is racist but calling “Palestine” an Arab and Islamic State, as is done in the <a href="http://www.palestinianbasiclaw.org/basic-law/2003-permanent-constitution-draft">Draft Palestinian Constitution</a>, is not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>###Palestinian Definition</p>

<p>1- Any Palestinian who claims descent from an Arab refugee of Mandatory Palestine regardless of their current area of residence or citizenship.</p>

<p>2- <strong>The UNRWA Criteria</strong> - Anyone “whose normal place of residence was Mandatory Palestine between June 1946 and May 1948, who lost both their homes and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict,” along with their patrilineal descendants.</p>
