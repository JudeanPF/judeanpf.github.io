  <span class="post-date">23 Mar 2015</span>
  <p>###And only Hillary’s candidacy (though not election) can save the US-Israel relationship</p>

<p>Yesterday, John McLaughlin, a Republican pollster who was working for the Likud campaign this year, sat down with <a href="https://soundcloud.com/catsroundtable/3-22-15-cats-roundtable-national">John Catsimatidis to discuss the election</a>. Aside from mentioning that internal Likud polls showed their party ahead at a time when all external polls put them behind and allegations US taxpayer money funded the V15 campaign to defeat Netanyahu, McLaughlin said something that should get international attention but won’t:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The State Department people in the end of January, early February, expedited visas for [Israeli] Arab leaders to come to the United States to learn how to vote. They used to be in three different parties that had 11 members of Knesset… they moved up this time… There were people in the United States that were organizing them to vote in one party so they would help the left-of-center candidate, Herzog, that the Obama administration favored.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He doesn’t go into detail about which Israeli Arab leaders came to America, but it is clear they were members of the Joint Arab List. As we have <a href="http://judeanpf.com/2015/03/15/Why-Arab-Parties-are-never-in-governing-coalitions/">pointed out</a>, despite its neutral sounding name, <strong>the Joint List is an amalgam of Communists, anti-Zionists, Islamists, and Palestinian Nationalists</strong>. None of its leaders has come out in support of Israel as a Jewish State (at least not to our knowledge), with some (Masud Ghnaim, Ibrahim Sarsur) advocate replacing Israel with an Islamic Caliphate and support enemy regimes like Syria and Iran and terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/W4Pkqax.jpg" alt="Masud Ghnaim" /></p>

<p>Shouldn’t it be news that the Obama White House invited anti-Zionist and Islamist Arabs to Washington to support their goal of unseating the Israeli Prime Minister? Of course it should! But given the lack of attention invitations to the Muslim Brotherhood - Hamas’s parent organization - got in <a href="http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/04/muslim-brotherhood-delegation-meets-with-white-house-119647.html">2012</a> and <a href="http://www.clarionproject.org/analysis/obama-meets-us-muslim-brotherhood-leaders">this year</a>, it certainly isn’t surprising this followed the same path to obscurity. It was even less likely to make waves since the media was so enamored of the idea of a single, unified Arab party in Israel that almost no Western news outlet discussed its radical Islamist and anti-Zionist ideology.</p>

<p>###Hillary’s Role</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/myxqKYR.jpg" alt="Hillary" /></p>

<p>Given Obama’s very public temper tantrum in the wake of Netanyahu’s victory, we must all take his threats to ‘reassess the US-Israel relationship’ including removing American support at the UN, seriously.</p>

<p>Of course, the growing list of Republican presidential candidates are going to hammer the President on his continued anti-Israel actions, but these can be brushed aside as partisan (even when they are legitimate, as is the case here). However, Obama will not have as easy a time shrugging off these attacks if they were to come from a fellow Democrat… and that is where Hillary comes in.</p>

<p>Let’s be clear: the Judean People’s Front is not convinced Clinton would be any better for Israel than Obama is; though it is certainly hard to imagine anyone being worse. In fact, it is pretty obvious that any of the Republican Candidates (with the exception of Rand Paul) would be better for Israel than Hillary. But Clinton’s candidacy will immediately change any discussion of the President’s anti-Israel actions from those actions themselves into a question of “Does Hillary Clinton support it?”</p>

<p>If Hillary wants to be president (we can all agree that she does, right?) she’ll need to toe the pro-Israel party line that she claims she believes in anyway. That means if Obama were to support anti-Israel resolutions at the UN, Clinton will be asked about it and have to speak out against it, making the attacks from the Republicans seem less partisan in the process. Moreover, most Democratic leaders are still unwilling to speak against Obama in favor of Israel out of loyalty to the president, however, when Hillary announces her candidacy and positions herself as the heir apparent to Obama’s throne, more Democrats will be able to speak their minds and doing so would also put them in line with their new leader.</p>

<p>Israel needs Hillary to announce her candidacy now. It is the only chance to reign in Obama’s anti-Israel threats and is Israel’s only option for avoiding a full rupture of relations.</p>

<p>That of course if Obama decides he doesn’t want to be the reason why the Democrats lose in 2016. If the President concludes that since he’s not up for reelection, he doesn’t care what happens next, he can throw caution to the wind and attack Israel as he sees fit. But at least his administration will have to do so amid relentless questions from journalists reminding him of Hillary Clinton’s rejection of his actions.</p>

<p>The Judean People’s Front never imagined we’d say it but:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Help us Hillary Clinton, you’re our only hope.</p>
</blockquote>
