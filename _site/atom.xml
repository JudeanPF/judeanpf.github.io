   <title>Will Israel Settle the Entire West Bank?</title>

   <updated>2015-03-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://judeanpf.com/2015/03/06/Will-Israel-Settle-the-Entire-West-Bank</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h4&gt;Sure, just give it 5,000 years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve heard it a million times: Israeli settlements are making a Two-State Solution impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Two-State Solution is the unquestionable, divinely ordained goal of the Left, and since we are told that settlements are making this not viable or have already made it impossible, this is a huge problem, worthy of global attention and condemnation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is accepted as fact by the average news consumer. But let&amp;#39;s take a few minutes and see if it actually holds up to the facts (hint, it doesn&amp;#39;t).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for the settlements to pose a threat to the Two-State Solution, they would need to take up a substantial amount of land. From a cursory view of the media and its obsessive, witch-hunt-like focus on the issue, one would certainly believe they do. So that begs the question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How much land do the settlements take up anyway?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of going to the Israeli government or the settler groups themselves, which one might expect to downplay the size of the settlements, let&amp;#39;s ask B&amp;#39;Tselem, the leftist Israeli &amp;quot;human rights organization&amp;quot; that spends most of its time and resources demonizing Israel when its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.algemeiner.com/2014/10/05/israeli-human-rights-group-btselem-admits-holocaust-denier-in-ranks-video/&quot;&gt;employees aren&amp;#39;t denying the Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Israel/Israeli_Settlements.html&quot;&gt;According to Yehezkel Lein&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at B&amp;#39;Tselem, the built-up areas of the settlements take up... &lt;strong&gt;1.7%!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://www.mappery.com/maps/Jewish-Settlements-in-West-Bank-Map.jpg&quot; ALT=&quot;some text&quot; WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=500&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you&amp;#39;re probably thinking, that can&amp;#39;t be right! They must take up more land than that or else they wouldn&amp;#39;t make headlines like they do. Well, let&amp;#39;s now go to the Palestinians and see what they have to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/erekat-olmert-offered-palestinians-territorial-equivalent-of-west-bank-1.393484&quot;&gt;According to Saeb Erekat&lt;/a&gt;, the chief Palestinian &amp;quot;peace&amp;quot; negotiator and Abbas confidant, said in 2011 that the built-up areas of the settlements take up... &lt;strong&gt;1.1% of West Bank!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This news is probably very jarring to you. Could it be that the settlements take up just over a single percent of the West Bank? Surely the municipal boundaries take up more land and that is the cause of the global outrage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, let&amp;#39;s ask Yehezkel Lein of B&amp;#39;Tselem again. How much land do the settlements take up if you include their municipal boundaries? An astonishing, astronomical, asymmetrical, astounding... &lt;strong&gt;5.1%!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But what about the additional land administered to by the local regional councils and military zones? Those end up taking roughly 40% of the West Bank. You&amp;#39;re trying to fool me with numbers!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re right, there is more land that is outside of the municipal boundaries that is controlled by Israel. This includes Area C and parts of Area B. But this was part of an arrangement the Palestinians themselves agreed to during Oslo. More to the point, since this is area is almost entirely uninhabited and only contains military outposts or bases, it can easily be evacuated and transferred to the Palestinians if by some miracle they ever agreed to peace and we were able to trust them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Israel has a history of withdrawing from territory and removing settlements and military bases in exchange for peace and in attempts to create conditions conducive for peace, but instead each time the territory has become a haven for terrorists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pnfRR3h.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Land Concessions for Peace&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1979 - Camp David Accords Israel agreed to a full withdrawal from the Sinai in exchange for peace. Stability reigned for years, but now ISIS affiliates have taken over wide swaths of territory and have attacked both Egypt and Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2000 - Israel unilaterally withdrew from all of Southern Lebanon, which was subsequently taken over by Hezbollah who filled it with rockets aimed at Israeli cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2005 - Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza and 4 settlements in Samaria only to have Gaza overrun by Hamas 2 years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2006 - Israeli voters elect Kadima, a party who&amp;#39;s sole platform was withdrawing from most of the West Bank, just as was done in Gaza a year prior. This was scrapped after the Palestinians voted in Hamas and it violently seized power in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel also agreed to withdrawal at Camp David in 2000, The Clinton Parameters and Taba in 2001, and Olmert&amp;#39;s Proposal in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is historical fact that Israel has committed itself to withdrawal and the removal of settlements when it believes doing so will help the cause of peace. It just happens that each time, abandoned territory has been used to make war instead. It isn&amp;#39;t the settlements that are preventing peace or even a division of the land, but rather Palestinian rejectionism and violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even in the face of all this, Israeli building in Judea and Samaria has been limited to &lt;strong&gt;just over 1% of the territory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s be clear about this: &lt;strong&gt;after nearly 50 years of Israeli control of Judea and Samaria, Israel has built up a little more than 1% of the land, which is expanded to only 5% with the municipal boundaries.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is right. At this rate, Israel will settle the entire West Bank... &lt;strong&gt;in about 5000 years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Alert the presses!&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Deconstructing Jon Stewart's attack on #NetanyahuSpeech</title>
   <link href="http://judeanpf.com/2015/03/05/deconstructing-jon-stewarts-attack/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://judeanpf.com/2015/03/05/deconstructing-jon-stewarts-attack</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If any of you tuned in to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thedailyshow.cc.com/full-episodes/hmp9gu/march-3--2015---sigourney-weaver&quot;&gt;Daily Show&lt;/a&gt; last night, I&amp;#39;m sure you weren&amp;#39;t surprised by the singular focus on Netanyahu and the incredibly childish way in which Jon Stewart deals with his speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We at the Judean People&amp;#39;s Front - ever the optimists - were still shocked by the deranged views given by Acheinu Jon. We don&amp;#39;t countenance Splitters, so we&amp;#39;ve decided to take the episode apart point by point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way Stewart opens the show leaves no room for any doubt about what he is going to be discussing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shalom, my friends welcome to a very special night. Benyamin (sic) Netanyahu addressed Congress today in observance of the Jewish holiday of Suuk-on-it Mr. President. It was a Festival of Slights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/qfiYjX0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Suuk-on-it Mr. President&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why didn&amp;#39;t Boehner consult with the White House?&amp;quot; Stewart asks incredulously, before spending over half a minute merely mocking the speaker instead of discussing whether or not there was actually a snub. Is Congress a co-equal branch of government with the Executive that has every right to invite a foreign leader to address it? It is, but not according to Jon Stewart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He clearly knows better than the both the US and Israeli governments, even if he can&amp;#39;t even pronounce Bibi&amp;#39;s first name properly. We&amp;#39;re sure he is making his childhood Hebrew teacher proud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stewart continues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Netanyahu was on hand to explain to OUR Congress why OUR President should not be negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each time, Stewart accentuates the word &amp;quot;our&amp;quot; to show that this is &lt;strong&gt;our&lt;/strong&gt; government and Israel has no right sticking its nose in &lt;strong&gt;our&lt;/strong&gt; business. Of course the fact that it was OUR government that invited him in the first place is irrelevant because it was the Legislature doing the inviting instead of the Executive. But for liberals like Stewart, there aren&amp;#39;t three branches of the US government, only President Obama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/3XbEiu3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bibi&amp;#39;s Big Adventure&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then of course is the obligatory allusion to electioneering, because clearly the only reason Bibi would be speaking to Congress would be to boost his poll numbers and not because he genuinely believes in his message. Of course Stewart doesn&amp;#39;t mention that Netanyahu invited opposition leader Issac Herzog to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timesofisrael.com/herzog-says-he-wont-address-congress-with-netanyahu/&quot;&gt;join him in addressing Congress&lt;/a&gt; and was refused. He doesn&amp;#39;t mention that Kirk-Menendez is coming up for a vote soon and Netanyahu wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to go address Congress while trying to cobble together a new coalition, a process that can take weeks if not months. Stewart doesn&amp;#39;t mention any of this because his grasp of the situation is limited to only what Obama tells him he should be agreeing with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stewart then sets up the tape of Bibi explaining why he is going to Congress:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel I am representing all the citizens of Israel, even those who do not agree with me. A representative of the entire Jewish people. I feel a deep and sincere concern for the safety of all the citizens of Israel and the fate of our state and the fate of our people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZLC0jwV.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;I Speak for all Jews!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stewart then gesticulates and shouts: &amp;quot;I speak for all Jews!... including the ones who don&amp;#39;t want me to... because those Jews are wrong,&amp;quot; before talking about the long Jewish tradition of arguing amongst ourselves as proof that Bibi does not in fact speak for all Jews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A far more effective way to show that Bibi doesn&amp;#39;t speak for all Jews would be to play a video for the audience where Netanyahu says he is only &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; representative of the Jewish people, but not &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; representative of the Jewish people... What&amp;#39;s that? He did? I already quoted it but Stewart ignored the substance in favor of getting a laugh while misleading his audience? I can&amp;#39;t believe it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course Jon Stewart isn&amp;#39;t the first leftist Jew to manipulate Bibi&amp;#39;s words to make it seem as though he is arrogantly acting as the voice of all Jews. Just two days ago &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timesofisrael.com/sen-feinstein-pans-netanyahu-over-claim-to-speak-for-all-jews/&quot;&gt;Senator Dianne Feinstein made the same accusation&lt;/a&gt;, referencing Bibi&amp;#39;s insistence of going to Paris after Jews were murdered in a kosher supermarket. But then also, he was careful to say he was &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; representative, not &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;the only&amp;quot; representative of the Jewish people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feinstein and Stewart know they can&amp;#39;t say Bibi doesn&amp;#39;t represent some Jews, so instead they lie and claim he said he represents them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/K3uB6VO.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Batman Kippah&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stewart them makes some jokes about CNN hosting a debate between the anti-Israel leader of J Street, Jeremy Ben-Ami, and serial self-promoter, but outspoken defender of Israel Shmuley Boteach, asking, &amp;quot;When did CNN start hosting my family&amp;#39;s seders?&amp;quot; And mocks CNN for using a Jewish Star as their &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.videoblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/NZYZNeu.gif&quot;&gt;new star-wipe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He asks if they couldn&amp;#39;t get a Batman-style spinning yarmulke and jokes about CNN being shown in airports in this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xr1JfAj.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CNN Airports&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that he has the audience even more on his side with low-hanging jokes, Stewart continues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will the Obama administration handle this unprecedented eye-poke?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then cuts to video of Obama talking up his pro-Israel credentials. One would think it would also be helpful here to mention that instead of poking Obama&amp;#39;s eye, Netanyahu was even more effusive in his praise of the President during his speech to Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that isn&amp;#39;t the only thing Stewart intentionally leaves out. There is no discussion of the fact that Obama had &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/02/25/susan-rice-netanyahus-speech-destructive/&quot;&gt;National Security Adviser Susan Rice&lt;/a&gt; say Netanyahu&amp;#39;s speech was &amp;quot;destructive of the fabric of the [US-Israel] relationship.&amp;quot; Such threatening language was clearly chosen to warn Israel that the relationship is not as &amp;quot;unbreakable&amp;quot; as President Obama often claims. Of course even the most casual news reader knows that in the run-up to the speech, there was unprecedented anger from Obama towards Israel, but this uncontested fact doesn&amp;#39;t fit Stewart&amp;#39;s message so he just leaves it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stewart is known to use his Jewish background for jokes and even feigning anti-Semitism at times to get laughs. But his next statement, I think, went further than he has ever gone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how powerful Israel is. Their prime minister comes here, publicly slaps Obama in the face and the President&amp;#39;s response is &amp;quot;wha-nah, it&amp;#39;s ok, in fact you should know I&amp;#39;m buying him gloves so when he hits me it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt his hand as much.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about a secret power that Israel has over the US government, at a time when there is a visual to back up the old anti-Semitic conspiracy theory is irresponsible to say the least. Are you telling me Stewart couldn&amp;#39;t come up with a joke without resorting to something like this? He should know better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stewart then attempts to &amp;quot;strike a balance&amp;quot; by joking about Joe Biden. Of course, they&amp;#39;re all softball jokes devoid of substance, but it lets him claim to treat both sides equally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next its time to cue the video of Obama asking what would have happened if Democrats had invited the French President to address Congress in the run up to the Iraq War. This is of course followed by the obligatory jokes about Freedom Fries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Obama and Stewart fail to mention is that despite the personal dislike (some have called it enmity) the two leaders had for one another, President Bush never let it get personal or stand in the way of diplomacy. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://tws.io/1CzwzdB&quot;&gt;Elliott Abrams recently recounted&lt;/a&gt; Bush recognized the Franco-US relationship was more important than either of them and set up monthly meetings where both countries&amp;#39; National Security Advisors met in Washington. This allowed Bush and Chirac to maintain professional and diplomatic relations with one another while maintaining the distance needed to make it workable and crisis-free. Abrams noted, &amp;quot;It was a serious time commitment for the American and French officials, but that is because we were determined to quarantine bad personal chemistry and prevent it from infecting the entire relationship—a goal set by President Bush himself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear from this insider&amp;#39;s take that had the Democrats taken the step to invite President Chirac to address Congress under Bush, there would have been no flare up or personal mud-slinging, because President Bush refused to act in such a petty manner, even with leaders he couldn&amp;#39;t stand. It is also worth remembering that back in 2013 when Obama refused Netanyahu&amp;#39;s request to address the Knesset (unlike President Bush and Clinton), Bibi didn&amp;#39;t say a word, still met with Obama, and didn&amp;#39;t create a crisis over it. He acted like a statesman and swallowed the snub for the greater good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is all above Stewart&amp;#39;s shallow understanding of international politics so instead he makes outlandish claims that Republicans would have demanded Democrats inviting Chirac &amp;quot;be arrested for sedition and treason.&amp;quot; The idea that someone with such a large and impressionable audience can make such blatantly ridiculous accusations and only be called on it by the Judean People&amp;#39;s Front is shocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point we were ready to turn off the episode but we powered through because we were still waiting for Stewart to, you know, actually discuss the speech itself (we&amp;#39;re almost 7 minutes into a 20 minute show where only the first 10 minutes are about the speech and still nothing). So finally Stewart says, &amp;quot;After all that build up I was pretty excited for the speech itself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before he can actually talk about the speech, he has to make the obligatory jokes about the standing ovations and applause Bibi received. &lt;em&gt;How dare people act like they actually want to hear what he has to say or show their support for America&amp;#39;s greatest ally in the Middle East?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stewart, in his Old Jewish man voice says, &amp;quot;It was a miracle, a standing ovation that was supposed to last for just one minute, miraculously lasted eight.&amp;quot; Sure it&amp;#39;s kind of funny, but for someone insisting on using their Jewishness for both humor and a guard against accusations of anti-Semitism, it might be nice if he knew that tonight is Purim not Chanukah...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we get to hear some of the speech itself, but of course only a few, select lines that Stewart can subsequently manipulate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t block Iran&amp;#39;s path to the bomb; it paves Iran&amp;#39;s path to the bomb... Iran&amp;#39;s break-out time would be very short -- about a year by U.S. assessment, even shorter by Israel&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s time for a circumcision joke because Israel cut a little off at the tip of the assessment. Classy as always Jon. He then follows up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy sh*t, one year. Bibi, if Iran is that close, why didn&amp;#39;t you bring your urgent warning about Iran going nuclear sooner? Oh wait you did? (with a look of utter delight on his face) Apparently time was also running out 19 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut to Bibi&amp;#39;s address to Congress in 1996:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this regime... were to acquire nuclear weapons this would presage catastrophic consequences. Only the United States can lead this vital international effort to stop the nuclearization of terrorist states. Time is running out, we have to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stewart proceeds to joke about Bibi not aging because he doesn&amp;#39;t understand the difference between the two warnings and what a breakout period really is. Back in 1996, Netanyahu was warning about a possibility. Iran&amp;#39;s nuclear program was still in its infancy, with only minor facilities and lacking in major technical know-how. Had we heeded his warnings and worked towards a nuclear-free deal with Iran then, before its leaders had openly declared they would accept nothing short of being a nuclear power, we probably wouldn&amp;#39;t be in this mess today. Moreover, the one year break-out period Bibi talks about is the same one Obama says is acceptable. The current deal under discussion assumes that because of the oversight involved, if Iran violates the agreement, they&amp;#39;ll need a year before they can create a nuclear bomb. This isn&amp;#39;t crying wolf, that is the assessment of the US intelligence services. But Stewart either doesn&amp;#39;t understand the difference between the two scenarios or he is willfully creating a false equivalence to mislead his viewers. Either way, he has no credibility on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is Stewart done manipulating old tapes of Netanyahu for his own purposes? Of course not, so now we get the second of only two video clips from the speech that ostensibly is the centerpiece of this episode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Middle East, Iran now dominates four Arab capitals Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut, and Sana&amp;#39;a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which Stewart remarks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to act, just look how Iran has expanded its power since the fall of Saddam Hussein and the destabilization in the region. I mean, what kind of idiot wouldn&amp;#39;t have seen that coming in 2002... oh shalom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Md1l5Q9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bibi doesn&amp;#39;t age&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bibi on Sept 12, 2002: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take out Saddam, Saddam&amp;#39;s regime, I guarantee you, that it will have enormous positive reverberations on the region. The reverberations of what happens with the collapse of Saddam&amp;#39;s regime could very well create an implosion in a neighboring regime like Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Or the opposite&amp;quot; Stewart retorts as he happily jumps at his own setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So caught up in playing &amp;quot;gotcha&amp;quot; Stewart fails to recognize that it wasn&amp;#39;t removing Saddam that led to the instability in Iraq today, but rather the premature abandonment pushed through by President Obama, who insisted on pulling out all American troops from Iraq after the Surge (which Obama opposed) had finally brought stability, which he eventually admitted &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/09/25/fact-check-was-obama-against-the-troop-surge-in-iraq/&quot;&gt;succeeded beyond our wildest dreams.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; It would also behoove Stewart to remember that the 2009 attempted Green Revolution in Iran and Arab Spring followed the fall of Saddam just as Netanyahu said they would. However it never occurred to Bibi that America would have a President who would abandon those striving for freedom, throw our allies to the wolves, and squander every opportunity for positive change in the Middle East. Netanyahu was absolutely correct in his discussion of &amp;quot;positive reverberations&amp;quot; he just couldn&amp;#39;t foresee an Obama presidency that would ruin it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stewart then bemoans that &amp;quot;in the House Chamber, there was no such reflecting [on Bibi&amp;#39;s past record of &amp;quot;false predictions&amp;quot;].&amp;quot; It never occurs to him that this may be because they know the history much better than he does. But who needs history when Stewart can make more jokes about applause before his final mic-drop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not Netanyahu accomplished his goal of sabotaging a deal with Iran or mistakenly opened up a rift in US-Israeli relations, one thing is certain, the in-chamber response to this speech was by far the longest blow job a Jewish man has ever received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You sure know how to make your mother schep Jon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course Netanyahu&amp;#39;s goal never was &amp;quot;sabatoging a deal with Iran&amp;quot; but preventing the signing of a bad deal with Iran that would allow it to continue to develop nuclear weapons. With the ten-year sunset clause, Iran doesn&amp;#39;t even have to violate the deal in order to get nukes, all it has to do is wait out the clock. Preventing this eventuality was Bibi&amp;#39;s goal, but Stewart didn&amp;#39;t have a whitty or low-brow rejoinder, so it fell to the cutting-room floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next 4 minute long segment is completely devoid of any substance, doesn&amp;#39;t talk about the speech at all, and is just a way for Stewart to make some jokes about the media and photoshop Bibi, Obama, and Khamenei in compromising positions. This was followed by an interview with Sigourney Weaver which was completely unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s do a quick recap: this 20 minute long episode - -allegedly all about Netanyahu&amp;#39;s speech - only spent half the time on a segment about the speech itself, and of those 10 minutes, only two lines were actually discussed. The rest of the time was spent on dick jokes and manipulating old clips to fit Stewart&amp;#39;s predetermined conclusions and mislead the audience on every point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entire episode was useless as any sort of political commentary, which sadly is how it is seen by the majority of The Daily Show viewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet again Israel was falsely flayed in the town square by Jon Stewart who uses his own Jewishness as a shield against critcisim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a shanda.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2015-03-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://judeanpf.com/2015/03/03/bazaar-logic</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h4&gt;Bibi had barely finished speaking before the criticism came rolling in:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He said nothing new!&amp;quot; Complain those who previously were going crazy at the prospect that Bibi might reveal classified information about the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He gave talking points but no alternative to the deal,&amp;quot; say others with blinders on. &amp;quot;The prime minister didn&amp;#39;t offer any viable alternatives,&amp;quot; Obama said after skipping the speech and not even turning on the TV to listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nancy Pelosi said she was so insulted by the &amp;quot;condescension,&amp;quot; that she was near tears. I would like to take a second remind her of Bibi&amp;#39;s actual words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel is grateful for the support of American — of America’s people and of America’s presidents, from Harry Truman to Barack Obama... We appreciate all that President Obama has done for Israel. Now, some of that is widely known. And some of what the president has done for Israel might never be known, because it touches on some of the most sensitive and strategic issues that arise between an American president and an Israeli prime minister. But I know it, and I will always be grateful to President Obama for that support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;#39;t sound condescending to me. It sounds incredibly respectful and appreciative. Later, as Bibi got into specifics, he was all policy, unlike his critics who leveled personal, ad hominem attacks against him (&lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; J Street &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the most striking criticism was &amp;quot;he wants us to go to war,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;he wants to stop the diplomatic processes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing could be further from the truth. So what did he really say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’re being told that the only alternative to this bad deal is war. That’s just not true. The alternative to this bad deal is a much better deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if Iran threatens to walk away from the table — and this often happens in a Persian bazaar — call their bluff. They’ll be back, because they need the deal a lot more than you do. And by maintaining the pressure on Iran and on those who do business with Iran, you have the power to make them need it even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NV0siIR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Persian Bazaar&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Obama sticks to his bizarre logic of offering concession after concession, Bibi understands #BazaarLogic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He knows that whether you&amp;#39;re in a Persian Bazaar, Arab Souk, or Hebrew Shuk, your strongest weapon is the threat that you might walk away. The second the seller thinks you won&amp;#39;t leave his stall without the item in question, you&amp;#39;ve already lost. You also need to be careful not to overplay this card or you end up like Abbas, who threatens to dismantle the PA every few months so no one takes the threat seriously. But if you haggle and go back and forth but make little progress, that&amp;#39;s when you say you&amp;#39;re done and start to walk. Before you know it, the seller is chasing you with a much better price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are obviously limits. If you offer a dollar for an intricate, hand-woven Persian rug, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you walk away because the seller would never accept such a paltry sum for his work. This is exactly what the Obama administration has been saying, &amp;quot;we can&amp;#39;t get a deal with complete disarmament or one that includes curbs on the ballistic missile program because Iran will never agree to one.&amp;quot; But if such restrictions are considered to be &amp;quot;too much&amp;quot; (something Obama didn&amp;#39;t agree with when he promised a nuclear-free Iran during the 2012 campaign), then Iran was never interested in negotiating to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EcOrSKs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Persian Carpet&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the opening of a bait and switch. You see a beautiful carpet hanging in a bazaar and the seller says he will only part with it in exchange for your first-born son, but if you&amp;#39;re interested, he has other carpets (lower quality, no doubt) in his shop if you&amp;#39;ll just step inside. Before you know it you&amp;#39;re caught up by the smells, vibrant colors, and fast talking merchant, remembering that you promised your wife you&amp;#39;d bring home a carpet no matter what, and instead of negotiating over the carpet you actually wanted, you&amp;#39;re haggling over one that you were never interested in to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iranians understand #BazaarLogic very well. It was their threats to walk away from negotiations that made the Obama administration run back to them with concession after concession. It was this threat that made Obama backtrack on his commitment to a nuclear-free Iran. It was this constantly looming threat to walk away, to leave Obama without his must-have deal, that excised any connection to the ballistic missile program and that caused Iranian hegemony to be spun as an asset rather than the greatest act of destabilization in the Middle East since the fall of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DNfOq7H.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bibi in Congress&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Netanyahu was right on the money when he said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friends, for over a year, we’ve been told that no deal is better than a bad deal. Well, this is a bad deal. It’s a very bad deal. We’re better off without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s time we let the Iranians know we&amp;#39;re done negotiating a bad deal (not any deal, but a bad deal) and if they are interested in real negotiations, they should tell us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But until then, the sanctions will increase and strengthen as we turn around and walk out of their Bazaar.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Blue-and-Whitewashing: Using Jews to cover up Anti-Semitism</title>
   <link href="http://judeanpf.com/2015/03/02/blue-and-whitewashing/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://judeanpf.com/2015/03/02/blue-and-whitewashing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re the type of person who is reading this blog (you poor unfortunate soul), chances are you&amp;#39;ve heard of the term &amp;quot;Jew-washing.&amp;quot; This term - coined by Yitzak Santis and Gerald M. Steinberg of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ngo-monitor.org/&quot;&gt;NGO Monitor&lt;/a&gt; in their article &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thejewishweek.com/editorial-opinion/opinion/jew-washing-and-bds&quot;&gt;On ‘Jew-Washing’ And BDS: How Jewish anti-Israel activists are gaining influence among Christian groups.&lt;/a&gt; - is the pro-Israel attempt to fight fire with fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BDS crowd has already had lots of success with &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mondoweiss.net/2011/11/a-documentary-guide-to-brand-israel-and-the-art-of-pinkwashing&quot;&gt;pink-washing&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; - accusing Israel of treating LGBT citizens as human beings solely for propaganda purposes - and is working on getting &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theislamicmonthly.com/an-interfaith-trojan-horse-faithwashing-apartheid-and-occupation/&quot;&gt;faith-washing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; - the idea that Israel is trying to get Muslims to betray their faith by simply talking to Israelis - the same success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santis and Steinberg do wonderful work defending Israel from organizations hell-bent on demonizing, delegitimizing, and destroying the Jewish state. They are great scholars and attorneys, but PR execs they are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while Jew-washing may technically fit the mold, it really sounds like it belongs in a mikvah. (h/t/ &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AnarchoZionist/status/564261462474907650&quot;&gt;@AnarchoZionist&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7at15HS.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Just your typical mikvah&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we here at The Judean People&amp;#39;s Front decided to help them out and came up with a term that we feel works much better:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Blue-and-Whitewashing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/6m2Iqw0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blue-and-Whitewashing&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;So what is #BlueAndWhitewashing anyway?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;covering up or glossing over the anti-Semitism of a group or individual by citing support from a small group of Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is typically done by anti-Zionist organizations who point to their buddies at Jewish Voice for Peace, Mondoweiss, or the Neturei Karta to say, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re not anti-Semitic, just look at all the Jews who agree with us!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why is a term like this even necessary? In order to answer that, we need look no further than the creator of the term &amp;quot;pink-washing,&amp;quot; Sarah Schulman. A &amp;quot;Distinguished Professor&amp;quot; of the Humanities at the College of Staten Island (your bubbe would be proud, though as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/134712/pinkwashing-sarah-schulman?all=1&quot;&gt;James Kirchick of Tablet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://elderofziyon.blogspot.com/2013/06/sarah-schulman-of-pinkwashing-fame-is.html#.VPCKVnx4qrg&quot;&gt;Elder of Ziyon&lt;/a&gt; have pointed out, she only has a mail-order Bachelor&amp;#39;s Degree from Empire State College, hardly an academic resume for a Distinguished Professor), Schulman, a lesbian and Israel-hater (which are by no means normally connected), needed to find a way to combine her two passions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she ran into a problem: if she actually cares about gay rights, how can she hate the only country in the Middle East that actually protects the rights and freedoms of its LGBT community? How can she fight for the Palestinians when they routinely murder gays to the point that &lt;a href=&quot;http://forward.com/articles/1125/for-gay-palestinians-tel-aviv-is-mecca/&quot;&gt;most Outed Palestinians must seek refuge in Israel&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oqA8lYF.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Homocrites&quot; title=&quot;(h/t ElderOfZiyon)&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to be undone by the facts, Schulman concluded that it wasn&amp;#39;t she who was wrong (shocker, I know) but Israel. Israel doesn&amp;#39;t actually care about gay rights, it only has pro-gay policies in order to distract the world from its horrible crimes against the Palestinians. Really, Israel exaggerates how open it is and in doing so, reduces its gay community to nothing more than pawns in its Hasbara machine. Sure there may be some &amp;quot;issues&amp;quot; with being gay in the Arab world, but really these are trending down and once Israel is destroyed, Arabs will surely embrace their gay brothers as they dance together on the graves of the Zionists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this sounds ridiculous to you, congratulations, you&amp;#39;re still able to distinguish fact from fiction and right from wrong, but then again, Blue-and-Whitewashers rarely use solid logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what I think I found the most interesting, was that Schulman herself is an open pink-washer! According to her fan, &lt;a href=&quot;(http://www.gilad.co.uk/writings/israelpalestine-and-the-queer-international-a-book-review-by.html)&quot;&gt;self-proclaimed Jewish anti-Semite Gilad Atzmon&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she is also interested in promoting her ‘queer political agenda’. For Schulman, &lt;strong&gt;Palestinians are simply a means toward her sacred progressive end&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;quot;If people like me are going to turn our backs on [Israeli] queer events in support of the boycott [BDS], then we must be assured that the boycott both recognizes queer support and acknowledges Palestinian LGBT organizing,” she writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Schulman, Palestinians are just &amp;quot;a means toward&amp;quot; an end. They are pawns that she uses for her own misguided &amp;quot;gay&amp;quot; agenda (I use quotes because she is not representative of the LGBT community and talking of some &amp;quot;Gay Agenda&amp;quot; makes me supremely uncomfortable). So in reality, Schulman is doing exactly what she is accusing the Israeli government of doing, except she is doing it for real! But I guess this won&amp;#39;t be the first or the last time the anti-Israel (&lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; anti-Semitic &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;) crowd engages in hypocrisy. What is different here, is that some Palestinians, like academic Joseph Massad, have noticed and complain that she is imposing a &amp;#39;Western concept of sexuality on Palestinian men.&amp;#39; This form of a cultural imperialism of the mind (never thought I&amp;#39;d write those words before) would surely be condemned by Schulman in any other context, but since it promotes her own agenda, it&amp;#39;s a-okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;But she&amp;#39;s just one person, who made up one catchy phrase, why should I care about her?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should care because she is on the advisory board of the ironically named Jewish Voice for Peace. She is the &amp;quot;Jewish&amp;quot; voice that is pushing for anything but peace. It is voices like Shulman&amp;#39;s who &lt;a href=&quot;http://proisraelbaybloggers.blogspot.com/2014/11/jewish-voice-for-peace-finding-common.html&quot;&gt;advocate support for terrorists like Rasmea Odeh&lt;/a&gt; and support the BDS movement to destroy Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s more, she is the Faculty Advisor for Students for Justice in Palestine at the College of Staten Island. She provides the same hateful guidance to SJP as she does for JVP and that shouldn&amp;#39;t be a surprise. The only reason why JVP gets more support from the wider Jewish community (but thankfully, still mostly on the liberal fringes) is because it sounds tamer than SJP, but in reality they share the same goals and tactics: the destruction of the State of Israel through intimidation and terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, it should really be called Jewish Voice for Palestine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/bbcaGQt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jewish Voice for Palestine&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the constant refrain from Arab anti-Zionists that Semites can&amp;#39;t be anti-Semites, we know this is not the case. Just ask &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4106265,00.html&quot;&gt;Gilad &amp;quot;Jews control the world&amp;quot; Atzmon&lt;/a&gt;, who, as it turns out, wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gilad.co.uk/writings/israelpalestine-and-the-queer-international-a-book-review-by.html&quot;&gt;mostly fawning review&lt;/a&gt; of one of her books. While Schulman is more careful not to specifically target Jews without using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog-whistle_politics&quot;&gt;dog-whistle&lt;/a&gt; of Zionism, you don&amp;#39;t have to dig very deep to see her hatred not just of Israel but of the Jewish people and her acceptance of classic anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. Not only that, but she herself talks about her own transformation from a “Jewish, lesbian New Yorker” into a “Cosmopolitan queer and avid BDS advocate,” that is to say how she stopped being a closed-minded Jew and opened herself up to the idea of global solidarity with hatred of Israel at its core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her obsessive focus on demonizing Israel and her desire to destroy the world&amp;#39;s only Jewish State (not to mention the only safe haven for gays in the Middle East) while completely ignoring all other countries, especially ones right next door that routinely arrest, torture, and murder gays and other minorities, is only attributable to a deep-seated hatred of her own people. But more surprisingly (well, not really, considering all we know of her) is the way she buys into the classic anti-Semitic canard of a Jewish/Israeli cabal running world events. When confronted by Jayson Littman, the Gay Jewish Zionist behind &lt;a href=&quot;www.myhebro.com&quot;&gt;MyHebro.com&lt;/a&gt;, Schulman absolutely loses it. According to Kirchick:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a November 2012 interview with the British lesbian magazine &lt;em&gt;Diva&lt;/em&gt;, Schulman said that “the more I work in this arena, the more aware I become of the involvement of the Israeli government in the US LGBT community.” She named Littman, among others, as “Israeli government operatives … who work for the Foreign Ministry, whose job it is to work our community along pinkwashing lines.” Among their tasks, she said, are to “plant stories in newspapers, co-opt our events … and flood websites with propaganda.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see? Littman is just a secret pinkwashing agent on a mission to dominate the media, control the actions of an entire community, and does so on orders from the Jews... sorry, I mean Israel. Isn&amp;#39;t it such an interesting coincidence that so many anti-Israel conspiracy theories fit so perfectly with ancient libels against the Jews with just one word changed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But getting back to the original matter of pinkwashing, I&amp;#39;m sure there are some of you who are thinking: but aren&amp;#39;t some Blue-and-Whitewashers really just against the occupation and not against the State of Israel itself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I suppose it is possible that some rank and file B&amp;amp;Wers believe this at first, but those at the top, especially Schulman, are 100% against the existence of the world&amp;#39;s only Jewish State in any borders (and use their positions to influence those beneath them). She is outspoken against the &amp;quot;crime of normalization,&amp;quot; that is treating Israel like a normal country by engaging with it in even the most mild of ways. The threat of normalization is what led &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=157&amp;amp;doc_id=12585&quot;&gt;PA officials to declare a soccer game between Israeli and Palestinian children a war crime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Gilad &amp;quot;I support burning synagogues&amp;quot; Atzmon, &amp;quot;Schulman actually provides us with a unique and invaluable window into Jewish secular progressive thought.&amp;quot; So it should be no surprise then that Schulman&amp;#39;s disciples over at Jewish Voice for Palestine are also active in the premiere, more &amp;quot;mainstream&amp;quot; anti-Israel, anti-peace group for Jewish secular progressives, J Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At J Street&amp;#39;s 2011 Conference, Jewish Voice for Palestine&amp;#39;s Executive Director Rebecca Vilkomerson, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jewishvoiceforpeace.org/blog/remarks-at-j-streets-bds-panel&quot;&gt;was invited to speak at a panel discussion of the BDS movement&lt;/a&gt;. The idea that a group professing to be &amp;quot;pro-Israel&amp;quot; would host a discussion on whether or not Israel should exist is just astounding... unless of course you know anything about J Street. Most Blue-and-Whitewashing BDSers claim to merely be &amp;quot;against the occupation&amp;quot; and point to the fact that the BDS movement calls for &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bdsmovement.net/bdsintro&quot;&gt;Ending [Israel&amp;#39;s] occupation and colonization of &lt;strong&gt;all Arab lands occupied in June 1967&lt;/strong&gt; and dismantling the Wall&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; But what they won&amp;#39;t tell you is that the movement&amp;#39;s original Mission Statement, drafted in 2005, calls for &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bdsmovement.net/call#sthash.iy3Vra4H.dpuf&quot;&gt;Ending its occupation and colonization of &lt;strong&gt;all Arab lands&lt;/strong&gt; and dismantling the Wall&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; and this has only been changed in English to make it sound more palatable to Western ears. But of course their third goal, &amp;quot;Respecting, protecting and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN resolution 194,&amp;quot; which essentially calls for the end of the Jewish State, has neve been altered, amended, or abrogated. While the BDS movement and their Blue-and-Whitewashing pawns are getting better at PR, their goals are just as nefarious as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when it comes to Schulman&amp;#39;s agenda, even Gilad &amp;quot;maybe the &lt;em&gt;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&lt;/em&gt; is real&amp;quot; Atzmon, doesn&amp;#39;t even fully believe her. Since Omar Barghouti - the Kuwaiti-born, Egyptian-raised, &amp;quot;Palestinian&amp;quot; PhD student at and graduate of Tel Aviv University who is leading the global BDS campaign (did that make your head hurt as much as mine?) - was initially opposed to welcoming Queer support for BDS (either because of his own or Palestinian society&amp;#39;s homophobia) Schulman beilieves she was able to win him over saying, “now I know that there is a significant Palestinian ‘civil society’ that supports a nonviolent strategy for change and is feminist and now pro-gay.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is too much for even Gilad &amp;quot;the Jews killed Jesus&amp;quot; Atzmon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very impressed with this revelation about a leading Palestinian civil society becoming ‘pro-gay’ and ‘feminist. I guess that &lt;strong&gt;Soros and his institutions&lt;/strong&gt; indeed have reason to be optimistic about their chance to change the face of the Arab society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, I would really like to know whether the Palestinians are aware of all this.&lt;/strong&gt; For some reason I have a feeling that, as in the case of BDS surreptitiously changing its goals statement, &lt;strong&gt;the same Palestinian civil society now has become ‘pro-gay’ and ‘feminist’ without anyone in Palestine knowing about it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Gilad &amp;quot;the Holocaust is the new Jewish religion&amp;quot; Atzmon makes sure to get in his &amp;quot;Jews control the world&amp;quot; conspiracy theory by talking about &amp;quot;Soros and his institutions,&amp;quot; he just can&amp;#39;t accept that Palestinians are actually pro-gay. Even this hateful anti-Semite recognizes the rampant homophobia in Palestinian and Arab society and can&amp;#39;t believe that has change just because Schulman says so. It would be nice if he applied this critical thinking to, well, anything else, but hey, it&amp;#39;s a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact of the matter is that both feminists and the LGBT community deserve better leaders than the likes of Sarah Schulman, but since many of those leaders are in fact Israeli, they&amp;#39;ll merely be smeared as pinkwashing and never get their chance to lead and better their communities. That&amp;#39;s because Pinkwashers and Blue-and-Whitewashers like Schulman don&amp;#39;t actually care about gays or Palestinians, they are just consumed with a hatred of Israel and Jews that takes over their entire being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because someone is named Sarah Miriam Schulman doesn&amp;#39;t mean we should sit back and take it while she uses her name to Blue-and-Whitewash anti-Semitism of the worst order. These Blue-and-Whitewashers should be named, shamed, and called what they really are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Traitors and Anti-Semites.&lt;/h3&gt;

   <title>About the Palestinian 'Refugees' </title>
   <link href="http://judeanpf.com/2015/02/26/about-palestinian-refugees/"/>
   <updated>2015-02-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://judeanpf.com/2015/02/26/about-palestinian-refugees</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Should Israel let them &amp;quot;come back?&amp;quot;(hint: It already has!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to have a discussion about Israel today without someone bringing up the Palestinian &amp;quot;refugees.&amp;quot; This is due to two reasons that are important to understand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people, being good and compassionate (he said not fully convinced) but not knowing much about the situation (he said more confidently), hear the word &amp;quot;refugee&amp;quot; and can be forgiven for automatically thinking, &amp;quot;hey, why can&amp;#39;t they just go home?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arab leadership knows about number one and has decided to cynically exploit both those emotions and lack of knowledge while the Palestinians and Israel are left to pay the price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if we&amp;#39;re going to have a real discussion about these people, we need to get passed the emotion and look at the facts of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How did the Palestinians come to be Refugees in the first place?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Palestinian &amp;quot;refugees&amp;quot; were created after Israel accepted but the Palestinian and Arab leadership rejected two peaceful offers of partition: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peel_Commission&quot;&gt;the Peel Partition in 1937&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine&quot;&gt;UN Partition of Palestine in 1947&lt;/a&gt;. Had either of these been accepted there would have been no refugees and no wars (and in the case of Peel, millions of Jews would have had a safe haven available to escape the Holocaust). Instead of accepting the peace proposals or offering their own alternatives (other than total domination and extermination), the Palestinians and Arabs responded with rejection, riots, and war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This rejectionism, coupled with violence, was the cause that started the refugee crisis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Did Israel create the refugee crisis?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what Palestinian propagandists claim, there was no organized or official plan by the Israeli government to expel the Palestinians. The general policy was the allow each military commander to make the decision whether to allow Palestinians who came under their control to stay or not. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://larryjhs.fastmail.fm.user.fm/The%20Birth%20of%20the%20Palestinian%20Refugee%20Problem%20Revisited.pdf&quot;&gt;Benny Morris&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;Only an extremely small, almost insignificant number of the refugees during this early period left because of Haganah or IZL or LHI expulsion orders or forceful ‘advice’ to that effect.&amp;quot; (p.139). The result was generally that Arab towns that didn&amp;#39;t resist were allowed to stay, while those that served as bases of attack were often expelled. However there were cases where some villages were forced out without resisting due to their strategic positions on supply roads and there were also cases of towns that, once subdued, were allowed to stay despite their belligerent past. Because of this policy, over one hundred thousand Arabs remained in Israel at the end of the war and their descendants make up Israel&amp;#39;s 1.5 million-strong Israeli-Arab minority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, unlike every Arab neighbor, Israel didn&amp;#39;t build a single refugee camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there were situations like the one that arose in Haifa. The Arab leadership of Haifa fled very early on and, after the city fell to Israel, no Arab was willing to publicly state that they should stay in the Jewish state for fear of being labeled a traitor. So, abandoned by their leadership and captives of the rabid anti-Semitism they had been fed for decades, 70,000 Arabs (nearly 1/10 of all Palestinian refugees) packed up and left, most after the military threat was gone (though admittedly still fresh in their minds) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://emperors-clothes.com/docs/haifa.htm&quot;&gt;against the active entreaties of the local Jewish population&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/books/review/Margolick-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0&quot;&gt;the Jewish Mayor of Haifa,&lt;/a&gt; to stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all in stark contrast to the officially stated and practiced goals of the Arab armies and this fact contributed to the fear that compelled many Palestinians to leave. Every single time a Jewish town was overtaken by Arab armies (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kfar_Etzion_massacre&quot;&gt;Gush Etzion&lt;/a&gt;), the population was either expelled or massacred. Knowing that this was their own policy, many Palestinian villagers assumed the Jews would do the same to them and fled before the Haganah even reached their towns. Thankfully the Arabs were only able to conquer a few towns, so the numbers of Jewish refugees from Judea, Samaria, and Gaza was limited to a few thousand. These refugees included the non-Zionist population of eastern Jerusalem in keeping with Jordanian policy to ethnically cleanse the holy city of all Jews. From 1949-1967, no Jew (or, for that matter, Israeli Muslim or Christian) was allowed to visit the Old City and Jewish holy sites were destroyed and desecrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UXKsBQo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hurva Synagogue&quot; title=&quot;Arab Legion soldier within the ruins, after the Legion blew it up for no reason. Behind him, remnants of the eastern wall show a painted fresco of Mount Sinai and two arched tablets symbolising the Ten Commandments. June 1948&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is interesting that while people are constantly saying Palestinians need to return to their homes, when Jews move back to the West Bank there is international outcry and condemnation...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Were the Palestinians the only Refugees?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the thousands of Jewish refugees from Judea, Samaria, and Gaza, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_and_Muslim_countries&quot;&gt;over 850,000 Jews from Muslim countries&lt;/a&gt; were forced out or compelled to leave at the same time. Unlike the Palestinians, these Jews were not recognized as refugees, were offered no international aid, and weren&amp;#39;t even in a war zone. The only reason why these people are not refugees today is because they were taken in by Israel and given citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EoKSHix.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Yemenite Jews&quot; title=&quot;Yemenite Jews en route from Aden to Israel, during Operation Magic Carpet (1949–1950)&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why are Palestinians still refugees?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gets to the real heart of the problem: the only reason Palestinians are refugees today is because &lt;strong&gt;the Arab states refused to resettle them&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;the United Nations went along with it&lt;/strong&gt;. Only Jordan gave them citizenship, but still insisted they stay in refugee camps. This led to a situation in which many people were often only living a few miles from their previous homes, in a completely identical society, and yet were prevented from rebuilding their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The refusal of the Arab states to resettle the Palestinians by forcing them to remain in refugee camps is only reason why Palestinian refugees exist today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every single war in human history has created refugees, and yet the Israeli War of Independence is the only one that has created perpetual refugees. In 1923 &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_exchange_between_Greece_and_Turkey%20exchanged%201.85%20million%20refugees&quot;&gt;Greece and Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, all of which were resettled. During WWII, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_refugees#Second_World_War&quot;&gt;roughly 2 million Belgians&lt;/a&gt; became refugees but were resettled and after the war, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/17P69ag&quot;&gt;12-14 million Germans&lt;/a&gt; became refugees but were resettled (with some 500-600,000 dying en route). 1946 saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/forced-population-transfers.htm&quot;&gt;200,000 Hungarians and an equal number of Slovaks&lt;/a&gt; cross borders as refugees before being resettled. Between 1944-1953 1.24 million Poles became refugees before settling in the new Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1947, &lt;strong&gt;the same year that the First Arab-Israeli War started&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India#Resettlement_of_refugees_in_India:_1947.E2.80.931957&quot;&gt;India and Pakistan were also partitioned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;creating 14.52 million refugees and roughly 1 million migration related deaths&lt;/strong&gt;. At 7.23 million, the number of Muslim refugees created was almost exactly 10x the number of Palestinians created at the exact same time. Yet for some reason (&lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; no Jews to blame &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt;) there was no real outcry over this in the Muslim world, no refugee camps remain, and no international agencies needed to be established to care for them. The Palestinians - and only the Palestinians - are perpetual refugees who refuse and are refused permanent resettlement in direct defiance of the goals of the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees, but perfectly in line with the rules and goals of their own personal UN aid agency, UNRWA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Would you let them into your country?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;#39;s put all this aside and say refugees have traditionally always be allowed to return, even their great-grandchildren, which we&amp;#39;ve shown is not the case; would you accept into your country a population greater than your own that is not only openly committed to your destruction but has been actively working towards it for 100 years? Would any sane country accept this? If India and Pakistan go to war again and India insists on moving 200,000 Hindus into Pakistan as a condition for peace, would Pakistan accept that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More to the point, if the goal is supposed to be Two States for Two Peoples (as we&amp;#39;re constantly told it is), then why do Palestinians insist on moving to Israel instead of a future Palestine? Shouldn&amp;#39;t the State of Palestine be where the refugees resettle? Years ago, when I first heard about this, being a good liberal Jewish youngster, I was convinced I was listening to extreme right-wing Israeli propaganda. The only reason it doesn&amp;#39;t surprise me anymore is because I now recognize that this is being advocated not to help &amp;quot;alleviate Palestinian suffering&amp;quot; or out of a sense of &amp;quot;justice&amp;quot; for refugees, but because such a move would destroy the Jewish State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Let&amp;#39;s Flip the Equation: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would the world&amp;#39;s reaction be if Israel said it would agree to a Two-State Solution but only if it could continue to build settlements in the Palestinian state to house millions of Jews?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that sound ridiculous? It should. But that is exactly what the Palestinians are insisting on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Who is responsible for the creating the Palestinian refugees?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, the blame for creating the Palestinian refugees is shared by the Palestinians, the Arab states, and yes, by Israel. Many Israelis get upset when I mention that we are also responsible for the refugees, but the fact that we are partially responsible is undeniable. We were justified in establishing our state and we didn&amp;#39;t have a policy to simply &amp;quot;expel the Arabs&amp;quot; (in direct contrast to the Arabs&amp;#39; policy of expelling or killing all Jews), but our actions still helped cause the refugee situation (and as I showed above, this was and is a constant by-product of war, not something unique to Israel). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we recognize that Israel is responsible for 1/3 of the refugee situation, we should ask ourselves, is there something can Israel do about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone asks you this, you should tell them that Israel has actually already fulfilled any obligation it has towards the Palestinian refugees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;What? How could this be, you say. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://soc.haifa.ac.il/%7Es.smooha/download/TheModelofDemIsraelasJewDeminNN.pdf&quot;&gt;Professor Sammy Smooha of Haifa University&lt;/a&gt; (p.487), between 1967 and 2001, &lt;strong&gt;Israel took in roughly 250,000 Palestinians&lt;/strong&gt; under the laws of Family Reunification &lt;strong&gt;and gave them citizenship&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You read that correctly, &lt;strong&gt;Israel has already taken in more than 1/3 the number of original refugees&lt;/strong&gt;. If Israel shares 1/3 of the responsibility for the Palestinian refugees and has already taken in more than 1/3 the number of refugees, what more should be expected of it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why have you never heard about this before?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t so clear. But it is likely due to the fact that since the Palestinians insist on their &amp;quot;Right of Return,&amp;quot; which would overwhelm Israel with millions of hostile new citizens, Israel is wary of giving this claim any legitimacy. By saying Israel has already taken in hundreds of thousand of Palestinians, Israel worries this would allow the Palestinians to say &amp;quot;if you took in 250,000, why not more?&amp;quot; However, since the Palestinians are insisting on the full &amp;quot;Right of Return&amp;quot; anyway, I see no reason why this fact should stay hidden and why Israel&amp;#39;s supporters can&amp;#39;t champion the unprecedented steps Israel has already taken in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is actually very ironic because, nowadays, the only time this is brought up is when anti-Israel activists smear Israel for not allowing the Palestinian spouses of Israelis move to Israel (the law was amended in 2001 after numerous Palestinian spouses engaged in terrorism after gaining Israeli citizenship). They are quick to denounce Israel for refusing to allow Palestinian wives and husbands to move to Israel but never say a word about the fact that over 250,000 already have. They also never mention that should a Palestinian state ever come into being, the Palestinians have already said that no Jews would be allowed to live there, whether they are spouses of Palestinians or not. But I doubt any of you are shocked by this hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without even getting into the more controversial topics of where the Palestinians actually came from and how long they were even living in Mandatory Palestine to begin with, it is clear that they are unique only in their perpetual status as refugees (not caused by Israel) and Israel has already fulfilled any obligations it may have had for their resettlement.&lt;/p&gt;
