        Just One Question for FM Zarif
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2015</span>

    <h3>About that Cyrus guy you mentioned...</h3>

<p>After Prime Minister Netanyahu&#39;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/03/03/full-text-netanyahus-address-to-congress/">masterful speech to Congress</a> last week, in which he clearly laid out why the current deal being offered is so dangerous in light of continued Iranian aggression and terror around the world, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif sat down with MSNBC&#39;s Ann Curry to respond.</p>

<p>Since Zarif has had so much experience duping American nuclear negotiators, the fact that he is able to do so easily to a reporter should be of no surprise.</p>

<p><IMG SRC="https://i.imgur.com/FRx9RCv.jpg" ALT="some text" WIDTH=700 HEIGHT=500></p>

<p>But still, Curry does of decent job holding Zarif&#39;s feet to the fire, asking him specifically &quot;Netanyahu strongly suggested that Iran has genocidal ambitions against the Jewish people, saying, &quot;Iran&#39;s regime is not merely a Jewish problem, any more than the Nazis were a Jewish problem.&quot; What is your response to that?&quot;</p>

<p>In order to counter this question that deserves a real answer from the Iranian negotiating team, Zarif digs deep into history saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, it is unfortunate that Mr. Netanyahu now totally-- distorts realities of today. He even distorts his own scripture. <strong>If you read the Book of Esther, you will see that it was the Iranian king who saved the Jews. If you read the Old Testament, you will see that it was an Iranian king who saved the Jews from Babylon.</strong> Esther has a town in Iran where-- where our Jewish population, <strong>which is the largest in the Middle East</strong>-- visit on a regular basis. It is-- it is truly, truly regrettable that bigotry gets to the point of making allegations against an entire nation which has saved Jews three times in its history: Once during that time of a prime minister who was trying to kill the Jews, and the king saved the Jews, again during the time of Cyrus the Great, where he saved the Jews from Babylon, and <strong>during the Second World War, where Iran saved the Jews</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I applaud the Foreign Minister&#39;s verbal and historical acrobatics, but it would have been nice if Curry challenged him on any of the many above inaccuracies.</p>

<h3>Ignoring Queen Esther</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/3/5/8157079/zarif-netanyahu-esther">Vox.com</a> called Zarif out for misrepresenting the story of Queen Esther. Yes it was King Achashverosh/Xerxes who &quot;saved the Jews from a Prime Minister,&quot; but it was the same king who had previously signed off on their annihilation and only countered the decree after the intervention of his Jewish bride.</p>

<h3>Did the Holocaust Happen or Not?</h3>

<p>Zarif&#39;s mention of Iranian efforts to save Jews during WWII was no doubt a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdol_Hossein_Sardari">Abdol Hossein Sardari</a> who did in fact issue hundreds of Iranian passports to Jews (both Iranian and non-Iranian) and is often called the &quot;Schindler of Iran.&quot; Given the Islamic Republic&#39;s history of Holocaust Denial, it is interesting that Zarif would mention this at all. But of course he doesn&#39;t talk about the fact that after the Islamic Revolution, instead of supporting such a worthy humanitarian, the new Islamist government rescinded his pension and confiscated his property. It must have been this &quot;generous&quot; policy towards those who worked to save Jews that convinced more than 90% of Iran&#39;s Jews they would be better off emigrating.</p>

<h3>Iranian Jews</h3>

<p>He also says that Iran has the &quot;largest [Jewish population] in the Middle East.&quot; This is nonsense. Israel has the largest Jewish population in the Middle East, followed by Turkey. If Iran actually had 20,000 Jews, as Zarif claims, it would have more than Turkey&#39;s 17,000, but a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Jews#Islamic_Republic_.281979.E2.80.93present.29">2012 census</a> at less than 9,000. But Iran&#39;s Jews are routinely trotted out by the government to <a href="judeanpf.com/2015/03/02/blue-and-whitewashing/">Blue-and-Whitewash</a> away its anti-Semitism.</p>

<h3>Back to that Cyrus guy you mentioned...</h3>

<p>But I think the most important question that should have been asked in response, was about Zarif&#39;s characterization of the actions of Cyrus the Great, who he describes as &quot;saving the Jews from Babylon.&quot; This is certainly true. However, what Zarif fails to mention is that in freeing the Jews exiled to Babylon, <strong>he allowed them to return to Israel and ordered them to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem.</strong></p>

<p><IMG SRC="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Illustrerad_Verldshistoria_band_I_Ill_058.jpg" ALT="some text" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=725></p>

<p>Upon hearing Zarif talk about King Cyrus the Great, how is the next question not: Do you recognize the established history that states that Cyrus not only liberated the exiled Jews in Babylon, but instructed them to return to the Land of Israel and rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem? Do you deny this undisputed fact of history, showing the Jewish connection and right to the Land of Israel that was also recognized by the great Iranian King Cyrus?</p>

<p>Cyrus&#39;s role in reestablishing Jewish life in Israel and rebuilding the Temple is not questioned by any historian. In fact, in 1953, when visiting the Jewish Theological Seminary, President Truman&#39;s Eddie Jacobson introduced him as “the man who helped create the state of Israel.” To which Truman responded, “What do you mean ‘helped to create’? <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116215/was-harry-truman-zionist"><strong>I am Cyrus</strong>.</a>”</p>

<p><IMG SRC="https://i.imgur.com/x3ssRMu.jpg" ALT="some text" WIDTH=566 HEIGHT=721></p>

<p>Of course Zarif can&#39;t discuss Cyrus the Great&#39;s central role in allowing the Jews to return to Israel and certainly not his orders to rebuilt the Temple because this would prove Israel&#39;s historical connection to the land and help justify its continued existence. It is this reason why Zarif also didn&#39;t mention the short-lived, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_conquest_and_occupation_of_Jerusalem">Sasanian-aided Jewish conquest of Jerusalem in 614</a> that was successful until Iran abandoned its Jewish allies to Byzantium, leading to massacres throughout the land.</p>

<h3>Which is it?</h3>

<p>Iran can&#39;t have its Jews and kill them too: either it recognizes that Cyrus allowed the Jews to return to Israel and rebuild the Temple, thereby recognizing the right of the Jews to the land, or it does not. It cannot celebrate the King for liberating the Jews and ignore what this entailed.</p>

<p>It would just be nice if one of the many journalists interviewing him actually called him on it.</p>

      <a href="/2015/03/08/Muslim-Grievances/">
        Why Obama's 'Muslim Grievances' policy towards terrorism is so attractive and why it is fatally flawed.
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Mar 2015</span>

    <p>The centerpiece of President Obama&#39;s speeches at last month&#39;s &quot;Summit on Countering Violent Extremism&quot; is the idea that the unnamed Islamic extremism is a result, not of radical ideology, but a reaction to &quot;legitimate grievances&quot; against America and the West.</p>

<p>Listening to his words, it at first seems that the President understands that terrorism is not causally related to poverty and other economic &quot;grievances,&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>poverty alone does not cause a person to become a terrorist, any more than poverty alone causes someone to become a criminal.  There are millions, billions of people who are poor and are law-abiding and peaceful and tolerant, and are trying to advance their lives and the opportunities for their families.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is incredibly important because it is established fact that wealthy, highly-educated people have become terrorists and billions of poor people have not:</p>

<p><center><IMG SRC="https://i.imgur.com/aAcsVnH.jpg" ALT="terror" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=350></center></p>

<p>But right after the President acknowledges this, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/02/19/remarks-president-summit-countering-violent-extremism-february-19-2015">he backtracks</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But when people -- especially young people -- feel entirely trapped in impoverished communities, where there is no order and no path for advancement, where there are no educational opportunities, where there are no ways to support families, and no escape from injustice and the humiliations of corruption -- that feeds instability and disorder, and makes those communities ripe for extremist recruitment.  And we have seen that across the Middle East and we&#39;ve seen it across North Africa.  So if we’re serious about countering violent extremism, we have to get serious about confronting these economic grievances.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea that Islamic Extremism (I&#39;ll use the term even though Obama won&#39;t) can be properly countered by addressing alleged economic grievances is bunk.</p>

<p>However, the President did say something here that actually is true:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that feeds instability and disorder, and makes those communities ripe for extremist recruitment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course someone who has nothing to lose and feels oppressed is more likely to buy into a radical ideology that tells him he isn&#39;t at fault and that all his problems are caused by America or the Jews. We know this is true because it was exactly the environment in which the Nazis rose to power in Germany. A humiliated people, ravaged by war, economy in tatters, were offered a vision in which they could claim to be the victims. It wasn&#39;t German warmongering that caused their dire predicament, it was the schemes of the Jews. In order to be the world superpower Germany was and should be, all you had to do was buy into an imagined past based on centuries of well-crafted anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>But it wasn&#39;t economic distress alone that caused the rise of Nazism (many countries are ravaged by war and don&#39;t end up turning to genocidal anti-Semitism). There were still plenty of wealthy, upper-class Germans who bought into Nazism - not because of the economic situation - but because it spoke to them as German Nationalists and fed on their history of anti-Semitism. It was these two factors that also provided the foundation for those more economically depressed Germans to see the Nazis as the answer to their problems.</p>

<p>This historical precedent also offers us a window into how we can achieve victory over radical Islam. When the Allies went to war against Nazi Germany, they didn&#39;t seek to end the war and make peace, they sought nothing less than complete victory and submission from the vanquished. After this was achieved, a process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denazification">Denazification</a> was enacted to undo the decades of brainwashing from Goebbels&#39;s propaganda machine. This was largely successful, but it overlooked a problem we are dealing with today: Denazification was only enacted in Germany and Austria, ignoring the Islamic world that was so receptive to the Nazi&#39;s supremacist and anti-Semitic ideology.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Lc8Ea5J.jpg" alt="Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1987-004-09A, Amin al Husseini und Adolf Hitler" title="Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1987-004-09A, Amin al Husseini und Adolf Hitler"></p>

<p>This message was widely accepted in the Muslim world with groups like the Muslim Brotherhood, whose founder, Hassan al-Banna, allying themselves with the Nazis and taking this message as their own. Despite their active collaboration with the Nazis, the Muslim Brotherhood was not prosecuted after the war and many Nazi war criminals a found safe haven among them. Booksellers on the streets of Cairo still openly sell copies of Mein Kampf - though without the sections describing Arabs as one of the lowest races of humanity. </p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ycPSmTI.jpg" alt="Hezbollah Salute"></p>

<p>The links between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relations_between_Nazi_Germany_and_the_Arab_world">Nazism and the roots of Islamic Terrorism</a> are well documented but completely ignored by Leftists like Barack Obama. Once a radical ideology takes up residence in a community, it cannot be excised without being countered on its own terms. Nazism wasn&#39;t defeated in Germany just by building up its economy and getting out of work Germans jobs, that would have just made Nazi Germany stronger. Nazism was only defeated when it was vanquished militarily and the population reeducated. This is exactly what needs to happen in the war against Radical Islam.</p>

<h5>If this is so clearly the case, then why exactly is the view that President Obama is presenting - economic grievances against the West are the driving factor in breeding terrorism - so compelling for many, especially on the Left? <br/><br/></h5>

<p>It is the same reason why anti-Israel, <a href="http://judeanpf.com/2015/03/02/blue-and-whitewashing/">Blue-and-Whitewashing</a> groups like J Street are gaining in popularity as well.</p>

<p>In promoting their &quot;pro-peace&quot; agenda, J Street lobbies for American pressure against Israel (and only against Israel) to make concessions and compromises for peace. This is because, in their view, the only reason there is no peace is because Israel refuses to end the occupation. Facts have no place in this discussion, so pointing out that <strong>Arab rejectionism and terrorism pre-dated the occupation</strong> or <strong>that the Palestinians have rejected four peace plans in the past 15 years and torpedoed numerous attempts at negotiation</strong>, does nothing to change the view of these groups. To them, everything is Israel&#39;s fault.</p>

<h5>But why would such an idea be so attractive to the Jews who join J Street?</h5>

<p>It is surprisingly simple: if everything is Israel&#39;s fault, if peace is absent only because of what Israel does, then Israel alone can change this. Jews can do very little to change the rejectionist, anti-Semitic, and pro-terror views of the Palestinians, but if all of those are really just a reaction to things Jews do (and not what Jews are) then there is an easy answer to the problem.</p>

<p>This is exactly why President Obama desperately needs to believe that Islamic Terrorism is a result of American policy and not a rejection of American values by embracing an opposing ideology. If everything is really a result of &quot;legitimate grievances&quot; caused by the United States, then President Obama just needs to address those issues and the problem will go away. But, if Islamic terrorists and their supporters actually believe what they believe for reasons independent of the US, then only a massive program of Dejihadification can stop them, and that is a much more complicated and messy matter.</p>

<p>Not only is this difficult because it involves militarily defeating ISIS and replacing its ideology, but it is more complicated than Denazification because Nazism was only a political ideology and political ideologies can be changed and countered by rival ideologies and by outsiders. However, the Salafi Jihadism that is practiced by extremists in ISIS, Hamas, and Boko Haram, is believed by them to be the only authentic form of their religion. Non-Muslims cannot counter this ideology with an alternate form of Islam, only Muslims can do that. So even if ISIS is defeated militarily, unless the Muslim world creates an antidote for radical Jihadism in the form of a more moderate and modern Islam, another will just pop up.</p>

<p>And that is precisely why President Obama&#39;s narrative is doomed to fail.</p>

<p>The shocking words of <a href="http://www.jstreetwatch.org/#!J-Street-CoFounder-Israel-Aint-a-Very-Good-Idea/c1nni/010525D6-93A6-402C-8526-3AAB2662EBB5">J Street&#39;s co-founder, Daniel Levy</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gZFBgLb.jpg" alt="Daniel Levy"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bottom line: if we&#39;re all wrong, and the collective Jewish presence in the Middle East can only survive by the sword, it cannot be accepted, it&#39;s not about what we do - sound familiar? They hate us for what we are, not what we do - if that&#39;s true, then Israel really ain&#39;t a very good idea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This disturbing idea, proudly stated by J Street&#39;s leader, is exactly what President Obama was saying at the &quot;Summit on Countering Violent Extremism.&quot; You just have to switch out a few words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bottom Line: if we&#39;re all wrong, and the Islamist ideology exists because its followers actually believe in its message and see it as authentic Islam, it&#39;s not about what we do - sound familiar? They hate us for what we are, not what we do - if that&#39;s true, then America really ain&#39;t a very good idea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The self-centered nature of Liberals will be our undoing if not actively countered. This idea that everything is really the fault of Israel and the West can be comforting because it imbues Westerners with an inflated sense of self-importance making them think they have the power to enact change on their own, can only lead to our own destruction.</p>

<p>This is exactly why it is also so dangerous.</p>

        Will Israel Settle the Entire West Bank?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2015</span>

    <h4>Sure, just give it 5,000 years. <br/><br/></h4>

<p>You&#39;ve heard it a million times: Israeli settlements are making a Two-State Solution impossible.</p>

<p>The Two-State Solution is the unquestionable, divinely ordained goal of the Left, and since we are told that settlements are making this not viable or have already made it impossible, this is a huge problem, worthy of global attention and condemnation.</p>

<p>This is accepted as fact by the average news consumer. But let&#39;s take a few minutes and see if it actually holds up to the facts (hint, it doesn&#39;t).</p>

<p>In order for the settlements to pose a threat to the Two-State Solution, they would need to take up a substantial amount of land. From a cursory view of the media and its obsessive, witch-hunt-like focus on the issue, one would certainly believe they do. So that begs the question:</p>

<h3>How much land do the settlements take up anyway?</h3>

<p>Instead of going to the Israeli government or the settler groups themselves, which one might expect to downplay the size of the settlements, let&#39;s ask B&#39;Tselem, the leftist Israeli &quot;human rights organization&quot; that spends most of its time and resources demonizing Israel when its <a href="http://www.algemeiner.com/2014/10/05/israeli-human-rights-group-btselem-admits-holocaust-denier-in-ranks-video/">employees aren&#39;t denying the Holocaust</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Israel/Israeli_Settlements.html">According to Yehezkel Lein</a>, a researcher at B&#39;Tselem, the built-up areas of the settlements take up... <strong>1.7%!</strong></p>

<p><center><IMG SRC="http://www.mappery.com/maps/Jewish-Settlements-in-West-Bank-Map.jpg" ALT="some text" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=500></center></p>

<p>Now you&#39;re probably thinking, that can&#39;t be right! They must take up more land than that or else they wouldn&#39;t make headlines like they do. Well, let&#39;s now go to the Palestinians and see what they have to say.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/erekat-olmert-offered-palestinians-territorial-equivalent-of-west-bank-1.393484">According to Saeb Erekat</a>, the chief Palestinian &quot;peace&quot; negotiator and Abbas confidant, said in 2011 that the built-up areas of the settlements take up... <strong>1.1% of the West Bank!</strong></p>

<p>This news is probably very jarring to you. Could it be that the settlements take up just over a single percent of the West Bank? Surely the municipal boundaries take up more land and that is the cause of the global outrage.</p>

<p>Well, let&#39;s ask Yehezkel Lein of B&#39;Tselem again. How much land do the settlements take up if you include their municipal boundaries? An astonishing, astronomical, asymmetrical, astounding... <strong>5.1%!</strong></p>

<p><em>But what about the additional land administered to by the local regional councils and military zones? Those end up taking roughly 40% of the West Bank. You&#39;re trying to fool me with numbers!</em></p>

<p>Not at all.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, there is more land that is outside of the municipal boundaries that is controlled by Israel. This includes Area C and parts of Area B. But this was part of an arrangement the Palestinians themselves agreed to during Oslo. More to the point, since this is area is almost entirely uninhabited and only contains military outposts or bases, it can easily be evacuated and transferred to the Palestinians if by some miracle they ever agreed to peace and we were able to trust them.</p>

<p>Additionally, Israel has a history of withdrawing from territory and removing settlements and military bases in exchange for peace and in attempts to create conditions conducive for peace, but instead each time the territory has become a haven for terrorists:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pnfRR3h.jpg" alt="Land Concessions for Peace"></p>

<ul>
<li><p>1979 - Camp David Accords Israel agreed to a full withdrawal from the Sinai in exchange for peace. Stability reigned for years, but now ISIS affiliates have taken over wide swaths of territory and have attacked both Egypt and Israel.</p></li>
<li><p>2000 - Israel unilaterally withdrew from all of Southern Lebanon, which was subsequently taken over by Hezbollah who filled it with rockets aimed at Israeli cities.</p></li>
<li><p>2005 - Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza and 4 settlements in Samaria only to have Gaza overrun by Hamas 2 years later.</p></li>
<li><p>2006 - Israeli voters elect Kadima, a party who&#39;s sole platform was withdrawing from most of the West Bank, just as was done in Gaza a year prior. This was scrapped after the Palestinians voted in Hamas and it violently seized power in Gaza.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Israel also agreed to withdrawal at Camp David in 2000, The Clinton Parameters and Taba in 2001, and Olmert&#39;s Proposal in 2008. </p>

<p>It is historical fact that Israel has committed itself to withdrawal and the removal of settlements when it believes doing so will help the cause of peace. It just happens that each time, abandoned territory has been used to make war instead. It isn&#39;t the settlements that are preventing peace or even a division of the land, but rather Palestinian rejectionism and violence.</p>

<p>But even in the face of all this, Israeli building in Judea and Samaria has been limited to <strong>just over 1% of the territory.</strong></p>

<p>So let&#39;s be clear about this: <strong>after nearly 50 years of Israeli control of Judea and Samaria, Israel has built up a little more than 1% of the land, which is expanded to only 5% with the municipal boundaries.</strong></p>

<p>The world is right. At this rate, Israel will settle the entire West Bank... <strong>in about 5000 years.</strong></p>
