I asked for a media empire, but the Elders of Zion only gave me a Twitter account and a blog.

We here at the Judean People's Front aim not only to rid our country of the hated Roman Occupation, but to fight against all demonization and delegitimization of Israel through facts and humor.

If you don't like it than you can go hang out with [Biggus Dickus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K8_jgiNqUc) for all I care.

And, as always, remember: You are all individuals.
