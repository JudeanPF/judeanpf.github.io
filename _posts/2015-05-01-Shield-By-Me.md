In the grand tradition of hijacking other people's causes for their own ends, we predicted that Palestinians and their supporters would quickly find a way to dishonor the life and death of legendary singer Ben E. King.

And we weren't disappointed (well, obviously we were, but you know what we mean):

In honor of notorious [Blue-and-Whitewasher](http://judeanpf.com/2015/03/02/blue-and-whitewashing/) Norman Finkelstein, the Judean People's Front brings you:



##Shield By Me - 
#####As sung by a Hamas rocketeer to his child human shield

![shield](https://i.imgur.com/M4504tj.jpg)

<br>

When the war has come

And the future is dark

And the rockets are the only lights we'll see

No, I won't be afraid

Though you will, be afraid

Just as long as you shield, shield by me

<br>

So child, child

Shield by me, oh shield by me

Oh shield, shield by me

Shield by me

<br>

If the sky, that we look upon

Should tumble and fall

And the roof should crumble on your head

I won't cry, I won't cry

No, I won't shed a tear

Just as long as you shield, shield by me

<br>

And child, child

Shield by me, oh shield by me

Oh shield, shield by me

Shield by me

<br>

So child, child

Shield by me, oh shield by me

Oh shield now, shield by me, oh shield by me

Whenever I'm in trouble won't you shield by me

Oh shield by me, oh won't you shield me now, shield

Shield by me

Shield by me
