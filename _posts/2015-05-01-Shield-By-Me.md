In the grand tradition of hijacking other people's causes for their own ends, we predicted that Palestinians and their supporters would quickly find a way to dishonor the life and death of legendary singer Ben E. King.

And we weren't disappointed (well, obviously we were, but you know what we mean):

In honor of notorious [Blue-and-Whitewasher](http://judeanpf.com/2015/03/02/blue-and-whitewashing/) Norman Finkelstein, the Judean People's Front, in collaboration with [Dr. Mike Harris](https://twitter.com/DrMikeH49), bring you the song Palestinians are really singing:



##Shield By Me - As sung by a Hamas rocketeer to his child human shield



![shield](https://i.imgur.com/M4504tj.jpg)

<br>

When the time has come

And the Jews are near

And the rockets are the only lights we'll see

No, kids don't be afraid

Nor will I be afraid

Just as long as my shield, stands by me

<br>



So child, child

Shield me, oh stand by me

Oh shield, stand by me

Stand by me

<br>

If the school, that we overtook

Should tumble and fall

And the roof should crumble on your head

I won't cry, I won't cry

No, I won't shed a tear

Just as long as you get me, on TV

<br>



And child, child

Shield me, oh stand by me

Oh shield, stand by me

Stand by me

<br>



So child, child

Shield me, oh stand by me

Oh shield now, stand by me, oh stand by me

Whenever I'm in trouble won't you shield me

Oh shield me, oh won't you shield me now, shield

Shield me

Stand by me
