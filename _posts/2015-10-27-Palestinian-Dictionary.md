title: "The Concise Palestinian Dictionary"
---

One of the biggest problems supporters of Israel are encountering today is not just ideological - Zionism vs. radical Islam - but rather linguistic. We know that while Israel haters have no compunction about lying, most normal people do. So when promoting their radical agenda the BDS-holes have a major problem:

####How can people committed to ethnically cleansing Israel of Jews through terrorism, people who support violently misogynistic and homophobic organizations, gain the support of good-hearted, progressive westerners?

Sure, getting the media to promote lies like "attacks on the Temple Mount" or framing a Palestinian stabber as a victim rather than terrorist help, but that can only go so far.

In order to win over the West, the Palestinians have simply decided to redefine the English language in a way that casts them in a positive light. That is why when talking to Palestinians and their supporters one cannot just consult an *Concise Oxford English Dictionary*, rather one must consult the *Concise Palestinian Dictionary* to understand their true goals.

Below, you'll find many important words with their Western definition and its Palestinian counterpart. You'll notice the common factor among Palestinian definitions is that they are almost invariably the exact opposite of the true meaning. (If you have a word you think should be added, please tweet us at [@JudeanPF](https://twitter.com/JudeanPF)).

___

##Apartheid

[*uh*-**pahrt**-hahyt, -heyt, *uh*-**pahr**-tahyt, -teyt] 

Noun. or Adjective.

###Western Definition

A form of government in which an ethnic minority dominates over the ethnic majority through a system of laws and violence that enforce segregation and discrimination in all aspects of life.

**Note**: As we have shown none of the [Apartheid Laws of South Africa exist in Israel](http://judeanpf.com/2015/07/27/Apartheid-Law-vs-Israeli-Law/) and most of them are explicitly illegal.

###Palestinian Definition

1- Any action - either large or small - taken by Israel that can be spun to sound racist in any way.

>[A law](http://www.adalah.org/en/law/view/493) preventing Israeli citizens from selling land to non-citizens for a certain period of time is labeled an "apartheid law" despite the fact that it applies to all non-Israelis (Jews included). Palestinians also label the security barrier an "apartheid wall" despite the fact that it was built to counter Palestinian suicide bombers ([and worked](http://www.adl.org/israel-international/israel-middle-east/content/AG/inaccuracy-security-barrier.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/#.Vifq9OxVhHw)).

2- Any action - even if it is exactly the same as what Israel is accused of doing - is no longer Apartheid when done by Palestinians or other Arabs.

>The fact that marriages in Israel are only conducted via religious ceremonies thus preventing intermarriages (though those performed abroad are recognized) *is* apartheid, but when the Palestinian Authority adopts the exact same arrangement, it is not. Though Palestinian law punishes those who sell land to Jews with [death or life in prison with hard labor](http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Abbas-adds-hard-labor-to-punishment-for-Palestinians-who-sell-land-to-hostile-countries-379350) since this isn't Israeli law, it cannot be considered an apartheid law.

___

##Ethnic Cleansing

[**eth**-nik klenz **in**g]

Noun.

###Western Definition

The elimination of an unwanted ethnic group or groups from a society, as by genocide or forced emigration. As a result, the population of a group that undergoes ethnic cleansing is invariably smaller afterwards.

###Palestinian Definition

1- Any act taken by Israel against a Palestinian individual, family or home, regardless of the act's legality.

>If a Palestinian illegally builds a home on land he does not own and is removed from it by Israel, that is ethnic cleansing.

1- To inflict capital punishment on; put to death according to law.

>After Ahmed Manasra stabbed a 13 year old Israeli on a bicycle, Mahmoud Abbas said he was executed even though [he is alive and well](http://www.timesofisrael.com/terrorist-abbas-said-executed-by-israel-shown-alive-in-hospital/).

2- When Israel kills a Palestinian who is attacking a civilian or soldier.

>The PA has complained that when Palestinian terrorists are killed while attacking Israelis, they are actually being "[executed in cold-blood](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/netanyahu-calls-palestinian-leader-a-liar-after-claims-of-execution/2015/10/15/da7a2a48-72b6-11e5-ba14-318f8e87a2fc_story.html)."

___

##Freedom Fighter

[**free**-d*uh* m **fahy**-ter] 

Noun.

###Western Definition

One who forcefully but peacefully struggles against tyranny in the pursuit of freedom for an oppressed people.

Notable Examples of Western Freedom Fighters:

* Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

* Mahatma Ghandi

* The Freedom Riders

* Partisans of WWII

###Palestinian Definition

Anyone who fights against Israel regardless of their actions. It doesn't matter if they attack soldiers, children or people on an airplane, anyone engaged in the "fight for Palestine" is automatically a Freedom Fighter.

* Airline Hijackers

* Murderers of Olympic Athletes

2- To have Jews discuss the Jewish history of or religious connection to any site.

>Any discussion of Jewish history on, Jewish connection to or rights for freedom of worship, on the Temple Mount, constitutes an attempt to Judaize the site.

Noun.

###Western Definition

###Palestinian Definition

1- The right to flood Israel with a Palestinian majority.

**Note**: The Palestinian insistence on peace **and** justice is designed to prevent an end of the conflict that does not include the "right" of the "[refugees](http://judeanpf.com/2015/02/26/about-palestinian-refugees/)" to move to Israel. One can compromise for the sake of peace, but cannot compromise for justice, which is why the Palestinians put so much emphasis on "justice."

4- Any law or action - even if it is exactly the same as what Israel is accused of doing - is no longer racist when done by Palestinians or other Arabs.

>The Law of Return is racist as it only applies to Jews but the "Right of Return" is not.
