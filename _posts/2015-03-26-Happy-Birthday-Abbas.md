title: "Happy Birthday Abbas!"

Today is Mahmoud Abbas's birthday and Fatah congratulated him on [Facebook with this post](https://www.facebook.com/fatehal3sfh/posts/843660442337132:0):

The picture says  "Another year and our President is doing great" (literally 1000x fine), which is the Arabic equivalent of "Happy Birthday."

Of course it's another year and "President" Abbas is doing great because this beacon of democracy hasn't had to stand for election since his first one in 2005. Sure he was only elected for a 4 year term, but since Abbas is the moderate leader of Israel's peace partner, the Palestinian Authority, the world can forgive this minor infraction.

While Israel's democracy is [questioned by the AP](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/2015/03/25/ap-editor-flunks-middle-east-101/), and accusations of Apartheid are chanted after Israeli Arab Supreme Court Justice Salim Joubran oversaw the elections, it is nice to know that Abbas is having another good year of dictatorship next door.

So from all of us here at the Judean People's Front, to our benevolent, peaceful, and moderate partner - who completely accepts the two-state solution despite personally turning down offer after offer, and who continues to reject the idea of a Jewish State and insist on the "Right of Return" for millions of Palestinians who never lived here to Israel - on the occasion of your 80th birthday, we would like to wish you a very heartfelt:

كل عام وأنت بألف بخير
