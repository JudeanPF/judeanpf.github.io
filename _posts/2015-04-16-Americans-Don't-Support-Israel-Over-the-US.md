title: "No, 45% of Americans Don't Support Israel Over the US"
---

Today, [Bloomberg released a new poll](http://images.businessweek.com/cms/2015-04-14/140415_bloomberg_public_69598.pdf) that many are using to say that Israel is now a partisan issue in the United States. If true, this would be a horrible development in which the strong bipartisan support Israel traditionally received would now be replaced by a European style, support only from the conservative side of the aisle.

This interpretation is based on two questions that we at the Judean People's Front are troubled were even asked:

>When it comes to relations between the U.S. and Israel, which of the following do you agree with more?

>* Israel is an important ally, the only democracy in the region, and we should support it even if our interests diverge.

>* Israel is an ally but we should pursue America's interests when we disagree with them.

and

>Recently there have been clashes between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Obama. Are you more sympathetic to Netanyahu or Obama?

It should be stated - though it isn't in the [Bloomberg article discussing the Israel questions](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-15/bloomberg-politics-national-poll-finds-deep-partisan-split-on-israel-and-iran) - that this was not a poll just about Israel. This was a poll about the 2016 Presidential Election. It contained questions about voter perceptions about potential candidates/Republican leaders (where Netanyahu was the only non-American listed, and polled better than all Republicans other than President George W. Bush), questions about Hillary Clinton's candidacy, and about the Iran deal. This means that those polled, were coming at these questions specifically thinking about the election, not necessarily about US-Israel ties in general.

###US-Israel Relations

>When it comes to relations between the U.S. and Israel, which of the following do you agree with more?

>* Israel is an important ally, the only democracy in the region, and we should support it even if our interests diverge.

>* Israel is an ally but we should pursue America's interests when we disagree with them.

The above question is incredibly problematic, should never have been asked, and, absent a specific situation in which it would come into play, completely impossible to answer.

The idea that American voters should decide whether or not they should support Israel even when it isn't in America's best interest smacks of the ancient anti-Semitic claim of Jewish dual-loyalty. "Jews are more loyal to Israel and other Jews than they are to our country," is a phrase commonly used by both Islamists and neo-Nazis. Yes, this poll wasn't only of Jewish voters, but given the history, that's what this question evokes.

Is it actually possible that 45% of Americans believe they should support Israel even when doing so would go against American interests? Such an astonishing and troubling number should be investigated, not accepted blindly. When looking more closely at the question it becomes clearer how this incredibly high number was reached: Voters were presented with only two options, one very pro-Israel and another less so and 45% chose the very pro-Israel choice. There was no outright anti-Israel option, meaning that Israel-supporters on the fence over the phrasing would be more inclined to choose the more pro-Israel sounding option, regardless of their reservations about it.

Bloomberg included the following that supports our understanding of the poll:

>Robert Veenstra, 31, a Catholic Republican and self-described conservative from North Port, Florida, who participated in the poll, said he doesn't yet have a strong preference among Republican presidential hopefuls—but that support of Israel is crucial. “I believe Israel needs the support,” he said... At the same time, he offered a caveat to his own view that the U.S. should support Israel's interests even when they diverge, saying **he's comfortable taking that stance because Israel isn't asking for anything that truly imperils the U.S.** [*emphasis JPF*]

>“While I care about the relationships we have with other countries, and other people's suffering, **at the end of the day my country is most important to me**,” he said. [*emphasis JPF*]

It is clear Veenstra chose the more pro-Israel option, but makes it plain that he still supports the United States in major disagreements. The reason he felt comfortable choosing that option was not only because of his strong affinity for Israel, but because Israel is not and has never made dangerous requests that might imperil the US.

But even if the wording was amended and an anti-Israel option was added, such a question still should not have been asked due to the anti-Semitic history around such questions. Sure a very small minority would support such a situation in which the US makes its own interests subservient to those of Israel, but such a small, fringe group doesn't deserve to have their views legitimized in such a way. It is reported that 45% of Americans believe in ghosts and 22% of Americans either don't believe al-Qaeda was behind 9/11 or aren't sure. Should such views be brought up for legitimate discussion in presidential polls as a result also?

Moreover, unless such a question were to give specific scenarios in which the US should support Israel to its own detriment, such a question is meaningless. More Americans would probably support backing Israel at the UN even though it would make US-Arab relations more difficult than would be willing to back an Israeli attack on Iran during US-led negotiations. Therefore, even without all the accompanying anti-Semitic baggage, the question is completely worthless.

###Obama v. Netanyahu: The Showdown

>Recently there have been clashes between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Obama. Are you more sympathetic to Netanyahu or Obama?

This question is equally useless.

People like Peter Beinart would like us to see this as proof that Conservatives in the US support a foreign leader over the President of the United States, tweeting:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>What would <a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNews">@FoxNews</a> say if Dems preferred foreign leader to US pres, prioritized foreign interests over ours? <a href="http://t.co/sin48Xk4No">http://t.co/sin48Xk4No</a></p>&mdash; Peter Beinart (@PeterBeinart) <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterBeinart/status/588322924068732928">April 15, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is nonsense.

**NEWSFLASH**: Conservatives in the US don't support President Obama!

Is anyone surprised by this? Should anyone be?

This question was a referendum on President Obama and his handling of the negotiations with Iran, with only slightly more Republicans supporting Netanyahu (67%) than are pessimistic about the Iran deal (62%) and Independents more pessimistic of the deal (48%) than supportive of Netanyahu (37%). 

Beinart should also recognize that the question didn't ask which politician they liked more, who they felt beholden to, or who they "prefer," as he alleges. The question asked "Are you more sympathetic to Netanyahu or to Obama [in the recent clashes between the two]?" Apparently in Beinart's America, citizens are required to support their president and his policies regardless of their own personal beliefs and should be shamed for stepping out of line, even if they only do so in an independent, anonymous survey. The idea that Americans would agree with a foreign leader over their own President is too shocking for him to contain himself... but only as long as that President is a Democrat.

###American Jewish Opinion

But perhaps our favorite part of the article comes at the very end, when Bloomberg interviews 26 year old Jewish Democrat Jeremy Fischer. It doesn't say his profession, if he is actively involved in politics in any way, or really anything other than his religion and party affiliation. He claims he'd be open to voting for a "moderate" over the Democratic nominee (read: Hillary Clinton) but insists Israel and Iran wouldn't be deciding factors, nor is he expecting to have to make that choice. The political dilettante then offers his view of Jewish voters, and we are apparently expected to take his view as representative, saying, "my guess is people closer to my age would skew one way and people closer to my parents' age or grandparents would skew another. The closer you are in age to the Holocaust the more likely you are to believe Israel is right all the time.”

We are almost embarrassed on Fisher's behalf that he ever agreed to give his opinion here. First, we have a picture of him as an uniformed partisan, who is influenced more by the fact that he is "just not a fan of Boehner" and sees Netanyahu as a "blowhard," but could see himself voting Republican. Second, we have him essentially admitting that he and other young Jewish voters - who he offers to speak for - are distanced from the Holocaust (very troubling), which he justifies as the reality given the passage of time. Finally, we have him offer up the long trotted out straw man claiming that to support Israel means "to believe Israel is right all the time." Mr. Fischer needs a good lesson in history, politics, and Yiddishkeit, but, sadly, this would likely have no effect on his religious affiliation with Liberal Judaism.

If Mr. Fischer and other young Jewish Democrats are unsure whether they would support Hillary Clinton or the Republican nominee, I suggest they take a good look at the issues they care about most and see where they line up; but regardless, Fischer has made it clear Israel is not one of them. If Fischer & Co. don't know the lessons of the Holocaust, I suggest they visit Yad Vashem, the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, or at least their websites today - it is Yom HaShoah after all - and then engage in some much needed Jewish soul-searching. Additionally, if Fischer believes the only way to be pro-Israel is to support every single action of the Israeli government, then he has failed to do even the most basic of research into the conflict, Israeli history, and the US-Israel relationship, and is likely a follower of Beinart and Jeremy Ben-Ami, who make their living off such spurious accusations.

Bloomberg should be embarrassed that it allowed such ridiculous, borderline anti-Semitic, and poorly constructed questions in its poll. But those touting these results without doing a modicum of independent research should be ashamed of themselves. Anyone claiming this poll says bipartisan support for Israel has disappeared is either biased, lazy, or both.

At least in regards to these two questions, this poll is utterly useless and should be treated as such.
