title: "Arab MK Posters"
---

[Our last post](http://judeanpf.com/2015/03/15/Why-Arab-Parties-are-never-in-governing-coalitions/) went into detail about the extremist positions of the MKs running on the Joint Arab List ticket.

But given that visuals are often more effective than well thought out arguments and blocks of text, we've put together some handy posters for use on social media.

Please help us make these spread!
