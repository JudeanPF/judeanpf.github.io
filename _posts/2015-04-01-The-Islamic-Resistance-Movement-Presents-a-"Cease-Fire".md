title: 'The Islamic Resistance Movement Presents a "Cease-Fire"'
---

##Yeah Right.

With all eyes on Lausanne and a potential nuclear agreement with Iran, the world's attention has shifted away from another potential agreement that was making headlines just 3 weeks ago: a Hamas-proposed multi-year cease-fire with Israel.

Last summer, the Islamic Resistance Movement, also known as Hamas, not only engaged in a war with Israel (alongside Islamic Jihad and Fatah), but continued in its campaign to deceive and dupe the world in a way that was successful beyond their wildest dreams. News media from around the world unquestioningly reproduced the Islamic Resistance Movement's lies about civilian casualties, disproportionate use of force by Israel, and refused to discuss the widespread use of human shields.

The main reason for this was spelled out clearly by [Matti Friedman of Tablet](http://tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/183033/israel-insider-guide) who blew the lid off the AP and international news media's obsessive and slanted focus on Israel. While explaining why in 2009 the media ignored Olmert's peace overtures to the Palestinians, Friedman explained "[the media's] narrative was that the Palestinians were moderate and the Israelis recalcitrant and increasingly extreme." The media and international community have been so convinced that the Two-State Solution is the only possible and just answer, that anything that contradicts it must be either maligned or altered.

It is this preoccupation with forcing a Two-State Solution that has led members of the media to report the Islamic Resistance Movement's "moderate overtures" without the slightest hint of journalistic questioning. Every few months a journalist will jump on a statement made anonymously (and only in English, of course) by a "senior Hamas official" indicating that the Islamic Resistance Movement has moderated and will accept a Two-State Solution. There is no skepticism offered because the journalists involved *need* it to be true.

That is why a letter from the Islamic Resistance Movement to Tony Blair, envoy of the so-called Quartet, was being trumpeted so loudly (despite [denials from the group that such a letter even exists](http://www.maannews.com/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=759809)). In addition the letter (which I have reproduced with comment below) Hamas has outlined the three conditions of its *tahidi'a* or quieting (as outlined by [The Times of Israel](http://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-offers-long-term-ceasefire-in-exchange-for-end-of-blockade/):


1. All forms of military conflict between Israel and the Palestinians will cease.

2. Israel will commit to removing the blockade on Gaza, including: opening all crossings around Gaza; permitting unfettered import and export from Gaza; allowing the construction of a sea and airport.

3. The *tahidi'a* will last between three and five years starting from the moment the agreement is signed, but the two sides will finalize the exact length of the ceasefire.


The media is excited by this "clear moderation" saying this proves the Islamic Resistance Movement has changed and is willing to live with Israel as long as the blockade is lifted.

This is utter nonsense as each of these three conditions are unacceptable to Israel as they would be to any country in Israel's position. Behind the pretty language, this is what the conditions really are:

1. Israel cannot take action against any terrorist group in Gaza, even in self-defense.

2. Israel will allow the Islamic Resistance Movement to build a sea and airport with which it can then import more weapons and war materiel without oversight.

3. The Islamic Resistance Movement will then be able to resume hostilities against Israel after an agreed upon timeframe when it is even better equipped to do so.

###Deconstructing Hamas's "Moderate" Letter

The letter itself is titled "The Current Crisis & Hamas Vision." Let's go line by line (this could take a while, but it's necessary) and expose it for what it really is:

>The situation in Palestine is obviously in its worst phase throughout the history of Palestinian struggle for freedom.

Really? We're supposed to believe not only that this is the worst it's ever been but that the Palestinians are actually struggling for freedom and not Israel's destruction? We're off to a great start!

>As a national liberation movement,

Stop right there. Let us be clear, the Islamic Resistance Movement, known as Hamas, is by no means a "national liberation movement." It is a "National Destruction Movement," run by Islamist Jihadis. The Movement's own charter makes any form of nationalism subservient to Islam. 

Look at Article 12 of the the Islamic Resistance Movement's Charter "Hamas in Palestine, Its Views on Homeland and Nationalism":

>Hamas regards Nationalism (Wataniyya) as part and parcel of the religious faith. Nothing is loftier or deeper in Nationalism than waging Jihad against the enemy and confronting him when he sets foot on the land of the Muslims...  the nationality of Hamas also carries... the all important divine factors which lend to it its spirit and life; so much so that it connects with the origin of the spirit and the source of life and raises in the skies of the Homeland the Banner of the Lord, thus inexorably connecting earth with Heaven.

Or from Article 13:

>the nationalism of the Islamic Resistance Movement is part of its faith

Or from Article 25:

>Hamas is a movement of Jihad

Nationalism is just a western word the Islamic Resistance Movement has appropriated and it is clear that nationalism is subservient to Islam. Hamas's ultimate allegiance is to Islam (or their interpretation of it) and not to any separate nationalism.

The letter continues:

>Hamas urges all parties concerned, particularly the Middle East Quartet to undertake their responsibilities towards the dangers generated by the unprecedented political deadlock on Palestinians. Theses dangers include the Israeli continuous Judaization of Jerusalem, attacks against Al-Aqsa Mosque, settlements construction, ceaseless aggressions at, and suffocating blockade of, the Gaza Strip among others.

Noticeably absent from the list of parties with responsibilities is of course the Islamic Resistance Movement itself. Surely only Fatah is responsible for the intra-Palestinian deadlock. And they wouldn't be Hamas if they didn't add in a list of imaginary crimes Israel is committing.

>The repercussions of the anger and despair in the Palestinian territories may lead to an explosion that might not only affect one party of the conflict but it may also extend to other parts of the region.

According to the Islamic Resistance Movement's narrative that has been largely accepted by Western governments, if Palestinians don't get their way, they are perfectly justified in engaging in violence. This view of Palestinians as children with no control over their own decisions is disgusting, patronizing, and racist.

But the really important part of this is the reference to "other parts of the region." This is a veiled threat to Egypt, which has enacted a much stricter blockade of Gaza than Israel and is fighting Hamas-aligned ISIS terrorists in Sinai. Hamas wants to avoid more violence with Egypt and knows this is mutual, so it is offering Egypt a way to avoid it by calling on it to pressure Israel to accept this deal.

The letter continues:

>We would like to stress the following points:

>1- Hamas is a national liberation movement that conducts its activities only within Palestine's borders.

We already showed that the Islamic Resistance Movement is not a national liberation organization, but this first point is meant to convince Egypt again that is is only interested in destroying Israel and will leave Sisi alone if he leaves them alone. This would be more convincing if there wasn't [concrete evidence of Hamas activity in Sinai](http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/middle-east/60802-150211-report-hamas-commander-killed-by-egyptian-army-in-sinai) as recently as last month. But I guess The Islamic Resistance Movement is hoping Egypt is just as gullible as the western audience of this letter.

>2- Having an Islamic background and moderate ideology, Hamas believes in positive dialogue between difference civilizations with no recourse to violence or oppression.

Anyone with even a minimal knowledge of the Islamic Resistance Movement, its ideology, and its actions will know it is in no way moderate. The only cross-civilizational discourse it knows is violence.

>3- Hamas has nothing to do with any sectarian, ethnic or political conflict in the region.

This is the same group that violently took control of Gaza and has persecuted, tortured, and jailed all its opponents there.

>4- (unpictured)...Palestinian struggle is struggle against the Israeli occupation not against Judaism per se.

The first part of this line isn't pictured, but the Islamic Resistance Movement is trying to distance itself from its anti-Semitic and genocidal charter. Sure, it isn't against Judaism "per se" only against anyone who practices Judaism and wants to stay alive.

The Hamas Charter is clear about how it views the Jews. Starting in the Introduction:

>For our struggle against the Jews is extremely wide-ranging and grave

From Article 7:

>The prophet, prayer and peace be upon him, said: The time will not come until Muslims will fight the Jews (and kill them); until the Jews hide behind rocks and trees, which will cry: O Muslim! there is a Jew hiding behind me, come on and kill him! This will not apply to the Gharqad, which is a Jewish tree (cited by Bukhari and Muslim).

From Article 13:

>“And the Jews will not be pleased with thee, nor will the Christians, till thou follow their creed. Say: Lo! the guidance of Allah [himself] is the Guidance. And if you should follow their desires after the knowledge which has come unto thee, then you would have from Allah no protecting friend nor helper.” Sura 2 (the Cow), verse 120 There is no solution to the Palestinian problem except by Jihad.

From Article 28:

>Israel, by virtue of its being Jewish and of having a Jewish population, defies Islam and the Muslims.

From Article 32:

>[Hamas] joins its efforts to all those who are active on the Palestinian scene, but more steps need to be taken by the Arab and Islamic peoples and Islamic associations throughout the Arab and Islamic world in order to make possible the next round with the **Jews, the merchants of war.**

If any other "national liberation movement" contained such anti-Semitism or racism against another people, it would be shunned completely. But since Hamas is talking nicer in English (though not Arabic, of course) people are willing to ignore it.

I wonder if the KKK would be accepted if they started talking nicer about black people while not denouncing their violent, racist past...

Ok, back to the letter:

>5- We seek to restore unalienated rights of the Palestinian people, believing if the political way achieves such objective, it would be the best.

That's interesting, especially since Article 13 of the Hamas Charter states "**There is no solution to the Palestinian problem except by Jihad. The initiatives, proposals and International Conferences are but a waste of time, an exercise in futility.**" This has not been updated, altered, or abrogated. You'd think that if the Islamic Resistance Movement was changing this policy they'd update their founding document and tell their people in Arabic. But these "changes" never show up in Arabic because they are for naive external consumption only.

>6- Believing in democracy and peaceful transition of power, Hamas cherishes respect for human rights in general and rights of women in particular.

The Islamic Resistance Movement only believes in democracy (a word not mentioned once in their charter) as a means toward establishing their Caliphate. They weren't so peaceful in 2007 when they broke their national unity government and violently seized control of Gaza. Gaza has one of the worst human and women's rights records in the world, and was responsible not only for using children as human shields, but also the [deaths of at least 160 children](http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/At-least-160-children-died-digging-tunnels-for-Hamas-369138) who died digging tunnels for Hamas. This is the type of respect Hamas has for human rights.

>7- Over the last months, Hamas has taken all necessary measures and made concessions needed for reconciliation. It also did its best to help consensus government succeed as the movement accepted to have the government formed of professional ministers and Palestinian national competencies regardless of political affiliation. It also agreed to rule out any steps or personalities that may disrupt the Government's work or being internationally unaccepted.

This is pure fantasy. The Islamic Resistance Movement agreed to a national unity government but never relinquished control of Gaza, forcing Palestinians wishing to enter or exit to go through 3 border crossings: 1 Israeli, 1 PA, and 1 Hamas (all Egyptian crossings are closed). What's more, after signing an agreement with Abbas, [Hamas began planning his overthrow](http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Massive-Hamas-infrastructure-in-West-Bank-planned-to-topple-the-Palestinian-Authority-371409) and was only thwarted by Israel. Anyone thinking Hamas will keep its word need look no further than how it held up its agreement with the PA.

>Being a major Palestinian faction, Hamas believes it's necessary to act immediately in order to end the crisis. Consequently, Hamas's vision is offered as follows:

>1- Hamas will not oppose a Palestinian state in the 1967 borders with Jerusalem as its capital and with keeping the right of return for the Palestinians.

Listen to that lukewarm approval. The Islamic Resistance Movement is so gracious not to oppose a Palestinian state in the 1949 armistice lines as long as it can also flood Israel with millions of Palestinians. That's because once Israel has a Palestinian majority as well, both states can be merged and Israel will be no more (any Jews who haven't emigrated at that point will likely be killed).

>2- Hamas is eager to install and continue the calm and complete searching the remaining issue including the airport and seaport through indirect negotiations.

Israel is surely comforted that the Islamic Resistance Movement is willing to stop attacking long enough to open weapons importing facilities by air and sea.

>3- Hamas is committed to the national reconciliation document signed by the Palestinian factions in 2006, which determined the common national position regarding all issues.

If this is the case, then the Islamic Resistance Movement would not have planned a coup in the West Bank and would have turned over Gaza to the PA.

>4- Hamas is committed to the agreements of the Palestinian-Palestinian reconciliation.

See above.

>5- Hamas is eager to have good relations with the international community as the movement is ready to talk to the international community over all the issues that may serve the international stability and peace.

This might be the only honest part of this letter. Of course the Islamic Resistance Movement wants good relations with the world! This whole letter is a propaganda ploy to make Hamas look moderate without actually having to moderate its positions on anything. Hamas is certainly willing to talk about how it will help "international stability and peace," but in Arabic it will make it clear that peace and stability will only come once Israel is destroyed and all the Jews are dead.

>6- Hamas demands to end the blockade on the Gaza Strip immediately.

All the Islamic Resistance Movement needs to do to make this happen is to disarm and hand Gaza back over to the PA. No Israeli government, left or right, will allow Hamas to import weapons at will and without proper oversight.

>7- Hamas demands to open all Gaza crossings and speed up reconstruction and development.

This point tries to make it seem like the blockade is preventing reconstruction in Gaza. Nothing could be further from the truth. According to the [Coordinator of Government Affairs in the Territories, since October 2014](http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Peace/Humanitarian/Pages/Further-steps-to-assist-reconstruction-of-Gaza-Strip-17-Feb-2015.aspx):

>So far, as a part of the reconstruction mechanism, over 62,000 tons of construction supplies have entered the Gaza Strip via the Kerem Shalom Crossing. In addition, 43,000 Gaza residents have purchased materials for the reconstruction of their homes, a process which is ongoing. Furthermore, 50 trucks and 15 buses have been transferred into the Gaza Strip.

What's more, [this was even happening during the war last summer](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/182742#.VRwwBfx4qrg). The Islamic Resistance Movement even cynically [fired on the Kerem Shalom crossing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBh2bY7Donk) while Israel was transferring in humanitarian aid.

Despite the "safeguards" put in place to ensure concrete goes to Gazans rebuilding their homes and not to the Islamic Resistance Movement rebuilding terror tunnels, [most concrete is being sold on the black market](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/25/corruption-hampers-effort-to-rebuild-gaza) where it ends up being used by Hamas.

Israel sends in building materials and then Hamas takes it for use in terrorism. The Islamic Resistance Movement is the reason reconstruction and development in Gaza is nonexistent... other than the terror infrastructure that is, which is being rebuilt at lightning speed.

>8- Hamas demands to work together with all parties concerned in order to bolster the national consensus government and help it succeed. This can take place through:
>--A- Implementing all of what has been agreed upon in this regard.
>--B- Adopting what Ziad Abu Amr and Ziad al-Zaza agreed upon relation to Gaza staff integration.
>--C- Adopting what Ziad Abu Amri and Ziad al-Zaza agreed upon in relation to Gaza Crossings.
>--D- Activating the issue of public freedoms and releasing political detainees.
>--E- Activating the national consensus government to undertake responsibilities toward the Gaza Strip and Gaza chronic problems.

What the Islamic Resistance Movement is really demanding here is that the PA and other Palestinian groups accept its dictates. If Hamas were interested in actually advancing a "national consensus government" it wouldn't be secretly planning coups, stealing reconstruction material, intimidating, imprisoning, and torturing political opponents, or [preventing children from leaving Gaza](http://www.maannews.com/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?id=750195) on field trips.

The Islamic Resistance Movement is solely responsible for the current situation and if it wanted to change it peacefully for the better it could do so. However, it is clear from Hamas's actions and it's words in Arabic that it is completely uninterested.

>Sincerely,
>The Islamic Resistance Movement - Hamas

Here is another thing that is often overlooked. Hamas (meaning "zeal" in Arabic and "violence" in Hebrew) is an acronym for "The Islamic Resistance Movement." It isn't "The Palestinian Resistance Movement," or "The National Resistance Movement," because neither of those ideas drives them. Hamas's commitment to Israel's destruction comes from its interpretation of Islam and from nowhere else. However, since it has a fun sounding acronym, people are able to pretend that it is something other than a radical Jihadi organization.

No one would ever say that Islamic Jihad or the Islamic State are just national organizations. Clearly they identify themselves as Islamists (despite the protestations of President Obama) and [it would be folly](http://judeanpf.com/2015/03/08/Muslim-Grievances/) to pretend they are anything else.

The Islamic Resistance Movement is one of many global Islamist organizations and just happens to be based in Gaza. It would be much more difficult for Hamas to claim to be a "National Liberation Organization" if it was called by its real name.

That is why, wherever possible, the Judean People's Front urges you to show the world they are Jihadi Islamists by using their true name:

###The Islamic Resistance Movement.
